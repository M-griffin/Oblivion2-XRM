Main List of Dependencies for Oblivion/2 XRM for Linux
Initial Information is for Debian / Ubuntu / Mint builds.

Compilation in Linux Mint
07/26/2019 - Initial Write up with new project folders and commandline build script.

Requirements:
	sqlite
	yaml-cpp
	openssl
	libssh
	uuid
	boost
    unittest-cpp

Note, Boost is only used for the menu and prompt conversion utilities

Note: I haven't built the system from scratch in a while, if something is missing please let me know.
Linux using apt-get:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential
        sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev
        sudo apt-get install libssh-dev
        sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
        sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
        sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
        sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev

Clone the project - This will checkout and create project in current folder.

        git clone https://github.com/M-griffin/Oblivion2-XRM.git .

        cd build
	   ./build-linux.sh -j2  (Notes, -j# is number of cpu cores for faster compiling, use a high number if you have more cores)

This will build all project files and copy the executables back to the build folder
once completed.

        ./xrm-server              - to start the bbs
        ./xrm-unittest            - to run the unit tests
        ./xrm-menu-convert        - convert Legacy Obv/2 menus to yaml format for XRM.
        ./xrm-menu-prompt-comvert - convert Legacy Obv/2 prompt to yaml format for XRM.

The default port will be 6023 and can be updated in the xrm-server.yaml configuration that gets auto-generated after you run the system the first time.

All data files, and configuration file are generated on the initial startup of the system.
If you goof anything up, simply delete the file and re-run the program and it will re-generate as needed.
