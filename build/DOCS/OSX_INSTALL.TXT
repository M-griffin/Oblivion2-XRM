#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Homebrew Note, Some might not use Homebrew for their package management
However, I needed to setup specific Include file locations in the .mk Makefiles
And so if you do NOT use Homebrew, then these paths would need to be updated manually.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: Requirements, you should have XCode w/ Command line Tools installed.
If not, you can usually install this from the APP Store.

Install Homebrew:
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Update Homebrew - And Possibly your OS to the latest version:
  brew doctor
  brew update

Install Dependencies via Brew:
- We use brew as this is a good package manager and easily installs 
  All required libs to /usr/local/opt where the make files can find them.

  brew install sqlite3
  brew install yaml-cpp
  brew install ossp-uuid
  brew install libssh
  brew install openssl@3
  brew install unittest-cpp
  brew install boost

Optional Dependencies depending on your Development Environment
Install GIT to pull down project:
  brew install git

Install latest compiler with c++11 compatibility as NEEDED!
  I have the following version installed or later..

  Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)
  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.4.0
  Thread model: Posix
  InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin

  $ Only Need to install or upgrade if your version is lower then this!
  brew install clang

You can check check /usr/local/Cellar for program versions installed
All Lib and Include files are linked to /usr/local/opt


Clone the project - This will checkout and create project in an ``Oblivion2-XRM`` folder.

  git clone https://github.com/M-griffin/Oblivion2-XRM.git

  cd Oblivion2-XRM
  cd build
  ./build-osx.sh -j2  (Notes, -j# is number of cpu cores for faster compiling)

This will build all project files and copy the executables back to the build folder
once completed.

  ./xrm-server              - to start the bbs
  ./xrm-unittest            - to run the unit tests

# Helper Applications, Only used if you are converting legacy items or mods.
  ./xrm-menu-convert        - convert Legacy Obv/2 menus to yaml format for XRM.
  ./xrm-menu-prompt-convert - convert Legacy Obv/2 prompt to yaml format for XRM.

The default port will be 6023 and can be updated in the xrm-server.yaml configuration that gets auto-generated after you run the system the first time.

All data files, and configuration file are generated on the initial startup of the system.
If you goof anything up, simply delete the file and re-run the program and it will re-generate as needed.
