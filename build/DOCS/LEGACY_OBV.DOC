                          SECTION 1.1: GENERAL OVERVIEW
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               Oblivion/2 BBS was designed with two things in mind: The
          SysOp, and the user. This bulletin board program attempts to
          give the best of both worlds: Power for the SysOp, and ease
          of use for the user. With the unique menu editor, and
          configurable ACS system, the power is present. The
          possibility for change gives the SysOp his power, while also
          giving the user an easy interface for operations.

          List of major features:

          o    Powerful menu editor. Allows for configuring all aspects
               of the BBS.
          o    Configurable String editor. No more internal strings.
               Add a personal touch to your BBS!
          o    Optimized for increased speed. Runs fast on any machine!
          o    Support for multiple menu sets.
          o    Support for multiple stat screen sets.
          o    Echomail/Netmail Compatible.
          o    Configurable Data Area System. Create your own
               BBS/VMB/NUA listing, and configure them any way you
               wish. Similar to an online database, but completely
               configurable.
          o    Support for SR/PCBOARD.SYS/CHAIN.TXT door file formats.
          o    Support for up to 255 separated message/file
               conferences.
          o    Support for multiple prompts. User selectable.
          o    Integrated upload checking system! Checks all uploaded
               files for CRC, viruses, and runs age tests. Also
               includes ability for additional SysOp specified
               maintainence to uploaded files!
          o    Support for multiple, SysOp configurable archivers!
               Anything on the BBS can be packed and unpacked in your
               favorite archive type. Also includes automatic archive
               signature recognition. The BBS knows what type of
               archiver a file was packed in w/o looking at its
               extension!
          o    Advanced user editor with integrated searching
               functions!
          o    Parameter editor for easy control and maintenance of
               user levels!
          o    Advanced online RIP graphics support for transmitting
               graphic images over the modem.
          o    Configurable Generic Menu system. No longer do SysOps
               have to edit menus when they change commands. With the
               generic menus, the BBS can do your editing for you.


                            SECTION 1.2: REGISTRATION
                            ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               Registration of Oblivion/2 is simple. All of our
          registrations are handled through our HQ support system. This
          system, The Fringes, can be reached at 216-464-4856.

               The registration fee for Oblivion/2 is $50 US payable
          in either a cashier check or money order. Please fill and
          print out a copy of ORDER.FRM (available with the distribution
          ZIP or from the Fringes). Include the form with your registration
          fee.

               Please send registration to the following address:

                                Rony Daher
                                PO BOX 43364
                                Cleveland, OH 44143-0364
                                                USA

               Make checks payable to:  Rony Daher

               To clear up certain things about registration, keep
          these things in mind:

          o    A completed ORDER.FRM MUST be sent with your order.
          o    Personal checks are NOT accepted. If you send one, your
               order will be returned. Please send a cashier check or a
               money order.
          o    You cannot transfer your registration to a friend. All
               registrations are handled with us.
          o    Please do NOT send Canadian Postal money orders. They're
               hard to cash.
          o    If you're registering overseas, or anywhere outside of
               the US & Canada, make sure to get your money order from
               a larger bank. Smaller chains are VERY hard to cash
               here. For Europeans and Australians, Citibank seems to
               work well.
          o    If your handle on the Fringes is different than the
               SysOp name which you are using for your BBS, please
               indicate this somewhere on your ORDER.FRM. If you
               fail to do this, your registration may be delayed.
          o    Once you are validated on the Fringes, you are free
               to register at any time. You need not get any sort
               of approval as in previous release versions.


               Registration is handled through a serial number system.
          When we validate your registration, you will receive a ZIP
          containing a textfile named SERIAL.NUM. Inside this textfile,
          you'll find a BBS Name, BBS SysOp, and a 20-digit serial
          number. Enter that information in your Obv/2 config EXACTLY
          as they appear in the SERIAL.NUM. If the information is not
          correct, the BBS will not register.

               Should you lose your SERIAL.NUM, please contact any
          member of the Oblivion/2 staff, and a new one will be made
          available to you.

               If you decide to distribute your SERIAL.NUM file, a
           beta version of Oblivion/2, or anything reserved for registered
           SysOps only, your registration will be immediately cancelled.
           No questions asked. No refunds given. No exceptions made.

               If you wish to get in contact with the Oblivion/2 team,
          please mail us on The Fringes, or at this address. Due to the
          large amount of mail received, we cannot guarentee replies.

                    SECTION 1.3: FOR THE BEGINNING SYSOP
                    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               This section has been designed to provide general information
          for a SysOp who is not familiar with the basic operations of
          Oblivion/2. If you are an advanced user, or have more than the
          basic knowledge and understanding of the software, skip this
          section.

          (1) The DSZLOG - If you're new to SysOping or new to Oblivion/2
          you might encounter the error "Set the DSZLOG to C:\OBV\DSZLOG.1"
          or an equivelant. The DSZLOG is a textfile which logs the
          activity of one of Oblivion/2's support programs, DSZ.COM. DSZ
          is used by Oblivion/2 for X/Y/Zmodem Transfers. The BBS reads
          this DSZLOG file following a transfer in order to determine
          the status of the transfer. You see this in the upload/download
          status screen (displayed just after you upload or download.)
          If this setting is not present, Obv/2 will not run. The DSZLOG
          is set by adding the line "SET DSZLOG=C:\OBV\DSZLOG.1" into
          your AUTOEXEC.BAT, or a batch file that runs Oblivion/2.
          Replace "C:\OBV\DSZLOG.1" with the value that Oblivion/2 gives
          you.

          (2) Batch Oriented File System - Oblivion/2's file system is
          known as a batch oriented file system. This means that you
          are able to do operations on many files at once. Operations
          include downloading, uploading, typing, moving, deleting,
          changing, getting information on, and so forth. Almost all
          of Oblivion/2's file functions are designed with this sense of
          a batch. In order to utilize these powerful tools, you must
          create a batch of files. Do this by selecting files (using your
          up/down arrow keys, or the numbers 8/2 for up/down respectively)
          Once a batch has been created, you can execute one of the many
          batch functions (download, move, type etc.) and all of the files
          in the batch will be downloaded, moved etc. You can also create
          a batch by using wildcards or entering individual filenames.
          You may do this at a prompt similar to this (prompts may be
          different if SysOp has modified them).

          You may download up to 50 files

          Enter Filenames:

          When you get a prompt similar to this, you have several options.
          You can enter a filename, a wildcard or a number/range of numbers.
          The numbers correspond to the ones shown to the left of the
          filename in the file listing. Enter a range such as 10-15, and
          files 10 through 15 will be tagged for a download. Other batch
          operations operate in the same fashion. This batch oriented file
          system gives Oblivion/2 the flexibility and power that both
          SysOps and Users can appreciate.

          (3) The menu hierarchy - The default menu setup that comes
          with Oblivion/2 has been divided for an ease of use for
          the SysOp and user. In order to keep things neat, and keep
          related commands together, we have divided the menus into
          two different types. The first type is known as a user menu,
          and the second known as a Sponsor menu. The user menus contain
          commands accessable to ordinary users, and the Sponsor menus
          contain commands that are used to maintain said areas, and
          should only be executed by those of high security levels.

          I will illustrate a few menus and associated Sponsor menus
          so that you can better understand the reason for dividing
          them. The file menu contains commands like "Newsan Files"
          "Upload Files" "Download Files" "Get Information on Files" etc.
          The file Sponsor menu contains commands such as "Reorder File
          Bases" "Offline Cleanup" "Make File Areas" etc. As you can see
          the sponsor menu contains functions that are available to SysOp.

          (4) Creating the NEWS message base - SysOps can use NEWS to
          convey important information to their users. Before you can
          create this base, you need to know how to create a message area.
          Section 14 of this document contains information on creating
          message bases. Follow those instructions on the creation of
          the base, but make sure that the option "Mandatory" is set to
          ON. This will force the BBS to newscan the message base upon the
          user's login. When you post a new message in this base, all
          people with access will see the new message. You can create
          more than one news base, and give each of them different ACS.
          Users will have to have the specified ACS to view the new
          news messages.

                              SECTION 2: ACS SYSTEM
                              ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

              ACS, or Access Conditioning System, has become a reality
          for many BBS programs being produced today. With ACS you can
          allow and restrict user's access to a certain area to the
          board based not only on level but on Baud Rate, Time Left,
          Number of File Points and much more. In essence, ACS
          offers the SysOp "Total Control" of his system.

              Before any SysOp can use the ACS System, it must be known
          it can get very complicated (as you will see).  It can become
          a programming language in itself.  So if your access doesn't
          go as planned the first time, continue to experiment until
          you find the results you are looking for.

          The following is a list of valid ACS Commands:



          Flag                   Description
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
          -                      False
          +                      True

                                   if the user has 100 or more file
                                   points, OR if the user has a

          T90|FABC               - Creates an option that can only be
                                   used if the user has 90+ minutes of
                                   time, OR if he has flags A,B,C set.

                                   Main Level and Transfer Level
                                   Greater than or equal to 20 OR Allow
                                   User #2 to access this base from 1am
                                   to 2am.

          ***  There are 2 separate sets of ACS flags. Use the Fx ACS
          Command to access the first set of ACS Flags, and use the Ox
          ACS flag to access the second set of ACS Flags. Both sets of
          flags can be toggled on and off in two ways. First, both
          sets of ACS flags can be toggled on/off with the user editor.
          The second way to toggle these flags on/off is by use of the
          following menu commands.

          To adjust flags in set 1:

          Command Key: -S
          Function   : Toggles on/off flag in CString
          CString    : +x (turns on flag x) or -x (turns off flag x)

          To adjust flags in set 2:

          Command Key: -Y
          Function   : Toggles on/off flag in CString
          CString    : +x (turns on flag x) or -x (turns off flag x)


                                 SECTION 3: CONFIGURATION PROGRAM
                                 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               In version 2.0 and later, the configuration program is
          now an active part of the BBS.  No longer do you have to exit
          the BBS, and run a large, clunky config, but you can do all
          of your configuration needs online.

               The configuration program has a number of global
          commands. To Clear a field, use the CTRL-Y command, to
          advance to the next option, use either your arrow keys, or
          your ENTER key. To enter into insert mode, or to exit
          from it, use the CTRL-V option. To end configuration from a
          certain menu, use CTRL-Z (Unless otherwise told).

               Each Section of the configuration program covers a
          different aspect of the BBS. Use your arrow keys to navigate
          throughout the config.

               In the next part of this section, certain commands in
          the configuration program will be explained in detail.
          Commands that are obvious, will be skipped.

          System Information:

          Multinode Operation  - If you plan to run your system with
                                 multiple nodes, select yes for this
                                 option.
          Node Number          - This is the node number for the
                                 current node. Leave this at 1 if you
                                 do not plan on running more than
                                 one node.
          Mins to Time Out     - This value (in minutes) will tell the
                                 BBS when to hang up if there has been
                                 no keypresses from the remote side.
          Days to save log     - This number (in days) tells the BBS
                                 how long to save the system log. The
                                 log will automatically be purged after
                                 that number of days. This is primarily
                                 a security feature.
          Lines of Scrollback  - This number tells the BBS how many
                                 lines of text to save in the
                                 scrollback buffer. This buffer can be
                                 accessed via the F4 SysOp command, and
                                 is used to view any text/ansi that
                                 scrolled off the screen. The higher
                                 you make this number, the more memory
                                 you'll need.  If you make the number
                                 too high, your system will crash with
                                 an ERROR 203. Should this happen,
                                 lower this number!
          Page Times           - This number tells the BBS how many
                                 times to allow the user to page the
                                 SysOp. If he pages more than this
                                 amount of times, a textfile,
                                 ENOUGH.ANS, will be printed.
          QWKName              - (Max 8 letters, no extension) This is
                                 the filename
                                 that your BBS will generate when a
                                 user creates a QWK packet for
                                 download. ie: OBV2 would make a packet
                                 called OBV2.QWK.
          BIOS Writes          - If this option is Yes, then screen
                                 writes will be handled through the
                                 BIOS. This is very slow, but may
                                 sometimes be needed if you have
                                 multitasking problems.  For normal
                                 operations, change this to No.
          Use MAINTAIN.BAT     - Read the section on the upload checker
                                 for information on this batch file.
          Starting Menu        - After the BBS finishes with the
                                 MATRIX.MNU file (your matrix), which
                                 menu should it then go to. This option
                                 tells Obv/2.  Do not include a .MNU
                                 extension; That is assumed.
          Use Status Bar       - If you wish to use the status bar,
                                 turn this option on.  If not, keep it
                                 off. The status bar is located on line
                                 25 of your local screen. It gives
                                 important user info on the current
                                 user. There are three different parts
                                 to the bar. Toggle all of these by
                                 using ALT-B. You can also turn off
                                 your status bar at anytime by using
                                 ALT-B.

          System Information 2

          Data Library Ansis   - Tells the BBS if the ansis for data
                                 areas are in the current status screen
                                 library, or if they're in the textfile
                                 directory. Yes = Ansis in status
                                 library, and No = Ansis are in
                                 textfile directory. Note: If you enter
                                 yes for this field, and the ansis are
                                 not there, the BBS will then look in
                                 the textfile directory.
          Scan all areas       - When this option is set to yes, then
                                 the BBS will check all file areas for
                                 duplicates when globally uploading
                                 files. This method is slower, but
                                 there's no possibility of having the
                                 same file in 2 directories. If the
                                 option is set to no, then the current
                                 area will only be scanned for
                                 duplicates.
          Use upload checker   - If you want your uploads CRC tested,
                                 age checked, and virus scanned, turn
                                 this option on. Read the section on
                                 the upload checker for more
                                 information on the upload checker.
          SCAN Command         - This is the commandline of the virus
                                 scanner that the upload checker will
                                 use. IE: SCAN /A /NOMEM /NOPAUSE for
                                 SCAN.EXE from McAfee.
          Comment File         - This is the filename of the comment
                                 that the upload checker will add to
                                 your checked files. Make sure that the
                                 file is in your textfile. If you
                                 don't want comments added, leave it
                                 blank.
          File to add          - This is the filename of the file that
                                 the BBS will add to checked files.
                                 Again leave it blank if you don't want
                                 a file added.
          Age for files        - If the newst file in an archive is
                                 older than this date, then the file
                                 will fail the upload checker.
          Delete List          - This filename (in your textfile
                                 directory) contains files that the
                                 upload checker will delete from
                                 uploaded archives. Put one filename
                                 per line.
          Special Login        - This option is used to allow the SysOp
                                 to completely configure the login.
                                 If this option is set to no, the BBS
                                 will NOT display welcome files, check
                                 the notices, display status screens,
                                 check for new email etc.. (Everything
                                 the BBS does on a regular login).
                                 Instead, the BBS will just go to your
                                 starting menu as set in the CONFIG.
                                 (This defaults to TOP.MNU). If you
                                 want to alter any aspect of the login,
                                 or make a login that looks like
                                 another software's then this is the
                                 option you'll want to use. If you want
                                 to duplicate Oblivion/2's login to
                                 modify later, here are the commands
                                 that should be present in the
                                 beginning of your TOP.MNU file (or
                                 whatever menu you have configured as
                                 the 'startup menu' in the CONFIG)

          Allow G and I        - Allow use of the G and I commands
                                 from the message reading menu. These
                                 commands store replies and threads.
                                 In low memory situations, these
                                 commands can lock the system.
          Drop carrier after   - Toggle this option to YES if you want
                                 the BBS to drop carrier on users when
                                 they logoff. If you do NOT want the BBS
                                 to drop carrier on users after they
                                 logoff (if you're running Obv/2 as a
                                 door), set this option to NO.
          MAINTAIN.BAT door file-If on, the BBS will create a DORINFO1.DEF
                                 type of door file in the door directory
                                 before the BBS executes MAINTAIN.BAT. If
                                 your file maintainence program requires a
                                 door file to run, turn this option on.

          System Information 3:

          Swap to EMS          - Toggle this option to YES if you want
                                 the BBS to swap to EMS memory instead
                                 of XMS or disk.
          Swap to XMS          - Toggle this option to YES if you want
                                 the BBS to swap to XMS memory instead
                                 of EMS or disk.
         Open/Close FDF        - Tells tells the BBS whether to open
                                 and close the file description file
                                 while doing file listings. This option
                                 slows down file listings, and should
                                 only be used on multinode systems if you
                                 experience problems.
         Use Timeslices        - If you are running a multitasking
                                 operating system such as IBM OS/2,
                                 Microsoft Windows 95, or DOS based
                                 equivelants like Windows 3.11, and
                                 Quarterdeck DESQView, turn this
                                 option on, and Obv/2 will release
                                 CPU timeslices back to the operating
                                 system. This helps to speed the overall
                                 speed of both foreground and background
                                 tasks by making sure that the CPU isn't
                                 always processing instructions from one
                                 single task.


          Look and Feel:

          Top Ten Character    - This ASCII character is the one the
                                 BBS will use in the top ten bar graph.
                                 Commonly used ones are ÿ (ALT-255), or
                                 þ (ALT-254).
          Use Greater than     - If yes, the BBS will put a > sign
                                 before quoted text.
          Use Quote Headers    - If you want to use quote headers, turn
                                 this option on. Quote headers are
                                 strings displayed in the message at
                                 the beginning and end of a user's
                                 quoted message.  They tell when the
                                 person started, and stopped quoting.
                                 Common phrases: User Opened his mouth
                                 (start), and User Shut his mouth
                                 (end).
          Use Message Help     - Toggle this option to yes if you want
                                 to use an external screen (MESHELP.ANS)
                                 for the message reading help. (? from
                                 the message reading prompt)
          Use file help        - Toggle this option to yes if you want
                                 to use an external screen (FILEHELP.ANS)
                                 for the file listing help. (? from the
                                 file listing prompt)

          Communications:

          Manual Answer        - When this command is set to yes,
                                 Oblivion/2 monitors the carrier pin on
                                 your serial card. When this pin
                                 signals true (when the phone rings),
                                 the BBS sends the answer string.  This
                                 method is quicker than waiting for the
                                 "RING" message from the modem.  It
                                 doesn't work with all modems, so
                                 experiment.
          Initialization String- This string is sent to the modem after
                                 every call, and when first loading up
                                 the BBS. Use | as return, and ~, or
                                 comma, for pauses.  Use "+++" to put
                                 the modem into command mode.
          Hangup String        - This string is sent to the modem when
                                 you want it to hang up the phone.  Use
                                 the same symbols as above.
          Send Carrier Str.    - This string is sent when you want to
                                 send carrier to another user.  (ie:
                                 User is in his term program, and you
                                 want to switch form a voice call to a
                                 data call. User receives carrier
                                 (ATX1D), and you send carrier (ATA))
          Receive Carrier Str. - Same as above, except this will
                                 receive carrier. This is typically
                                 ATX1D.
          Lockout Password     - This password is required for a user
                                 to login when his baud rate is under
                                 the minimum baud rate.
          Wait Until Sent      - If this option is true, the BBS will
                                 pause until the output buffer is
                                 empty after a file transfer. This
                                 may help to alleviate problems with
                                 the higher speed modems. (28.8k)
          115.2k Locking       - If you want to lock your comport
                                 at 115,200 baud, set this option
                                 to yes. It will ignore the port
                                 lock rate, and lock at 115,200.
                                 SysOps with 28.8k modems should
                                 set this to yes for maximum performance
                                 from their modems.


          ACS Configuration:

          Post Anonymous ACS   - ACS required to post anonymously in
                                 any base. (See the section on ACS for
                                 codes)
          SysOp ACS            - ACS required to be a full SysOp. When
                                 you have this ACS you'll be able to
                                 access all SysOp commands. (Unless
                                 otherwise changed by the menu editing)
          Message SysOp ACS    - ACS required to have access to the
                                 message sponsor commands. (Again, this
                                 can be overriden by menu editing)
          File SysOp ACS       - Same as above, except for file system.
          Exec in MiniDOS ACS  - ACS required to use the *COMMAND, or
                                 &COMMAND commands in MiniDOS. *COMMAND
                                 will execute COMMAND after performing
                                 a DOS shell. Use this to run PKZIP
                                 etc..  &COMMAND will execute command
                                 w/o a DOS shell. Use this to run any
                                 commands that are internal to
                                 COMMAND.COM. (ie: DEL, ERASE, COPY)
          //\\COMMAND ACS      - //\\COMMAND is a quick way to execute
                                 any command from anywhere.  You must
                                 have the specified ACS.  To use
                                 //\\COMMAND, type //\\ followed by the
                                 corresponding menu command. For
                                 example, the menu command for text
                                 editor is *T. If you've got //\\
                                 ACS, you'd type //\\*T. This would be
                                 the same as executing the text editor
                                 from the SysOp menu, but you can do it
                                 from anywhere! Use this access with
                                 extreme caution. Anyone with this access
                                 can execute ANY command regardless of it
                                 being in your menus or not. If it's a valid
                                 menu command, the user will be able to
                                 execute it if he meets the ACS requirement.
          Post Mandatory ACS   - ACS required to post a message in a
                                 mandatory (NEWS) message base.
                                 Mandatory message bases are
                                 automatically newscanned upon logon to
                                 the system. Use them to post news
                                 bulletins. Be sure to purge them
                                 periodically, as they will get
                                 numerous.
          Topten exempt ACS    - ACS for users to be exempt from the
                                 top ten listing.
          Certified Mail ACS   - ACS required for a user to send
                                 certified mail. Cerified mail is a
                                 type of Email that sends the sender a
                                 notice when the receiver has read the
                                 mail.
          Filemail ACS         - ACS required to attach files to email.
          //\\xx ACS           - The remaining options on this screen,
                                 and ones similar to that in ACS
                                 configuration II are used to limit your
                                 CoSysOp's use of the //\\ ACS. Each option
                                 is as follows '//\\*? ACS' This is the ACS
                                 for any //\\ command followed by a *?. For
                                 example, //\\*T is the command used to
                                 activate the text editor. If you don't
                                 want your CoSysOp accessing any of the *x
                                 functions, but wish to let him have access
                                 to other menu commands not in your menus,
                                 set the ACS higher. (Read explanation of
                                 //\\ACS just above)

          File Section Config:

          K per point          - This is used to establish a file point
                                 ratio. How many K is one point worth?
          External Area Listing- If you have made an external file area
                                 listing, using either the straight
                                 ANSI method, or the repeat method, set
                                 this option to Yes.
          Repeat Method        - If you made your area listing using
                                 the Repeat Method select yes. (Read
                                 the section on making external screens
                                 for instruction on making repeat
                                 method screens.)
          Filepoint Commission - If this option is toggled to yes, a
                                 commission system for filepoints will
                                 be used. The commission system grants
                                 the uploader a percentage credit (in
                                 FP's), when someone downloads his
                                 file. This encourages good uploads. If
                                 nobody downloads the file, then the
                                 uploader doesn't get credits.
          Percentage Commission- Percent of the total filepoints to
                                 give the uploader when someone
                                 downloads his file. Example:
                                 Points per 10K = 1
                                 Percentage Commission = 100%
                                 User downloads a 100K file, and the
                                 uploader will get 10 points added on
                                 to his account.
          Times Point Back     - When you rate a file, the uploader
                                 will get that rating multiplied by
                                 this number. (ie: if this was 2, and
                                 you rated a file at 5 pts, the user
                                 gets 10 pts added to his account)
          Description form 1-8 - This feature allows you to append
                                 certain options to your file listing.
                                 You can let users know who uploaded
                                 the file, the date of upload, the size
                                 compressed, the size uncompressed etc.
                                 (see the MCI code section for those codes)
                                 If you wish to use these options, simply
                                 start at line 1, and add whichever options
                                 you want your users to see in the file
                                 listing. (Suggested that you use Uploaded
                                 by, and the date of upload)
          Lines of extended    - Tells the BBS how many lines of extended
          description            description to use. Maximum is 7. This
                                 option has nothing to do with FILE_ID.DIZ
                                 which will use more than 7 lines of it
                                 is infact longer than 7 lines.
          Percent Time back    - How much time back (in %) should the
                                 user get back after his upload.
          Autovalidate files   - If yes, files will automatically be
                                 validated after upload. Otherwise,
                                 they will be marked as NEW, and
                                 must be manually validated.
          Min K for upload     - (in Kbytes) When your HD his this
                                 amount of space, or less, uploads will
                                 not be accepted.
          Use Average CPS      - If this option is set to true, time
                                 estimates for transfers will be made
                                 on the average CPS rate of that user.
                                 If it's set to no, time estimates will
                                 be made based upon the connect rate.
          Extraction Percent   - When the user extracts a file, he is
                                 charged the file size multiplied by
                                 the percentage in this field. For example,
                                 if the user extracts a 100K file, and this
                                 value is set to 60%, then the user is
                                 charged 60K for the extraction. If file
                                 points are used, the extraction percentage
                                 is multiplied by 1/total # of filepoints
                                 to determine how many credits to remove.

          Email Config:

          Allow Filemail       - When this option is set to yes, users
                                 will be allowed to send files to each
                                 other through Email.
          Days to keep filemail- Filemail will be kept for this amount
                                 of days. It will then be auto-purged.

          Message Section:

          External Base List   - Use an external base listing in the
                                 message section?  (See section on
                                 making an external listings in these
                                 docs)

          Repeat Method        - If you made your base listing using
                                 the repeat method, select yes.

          Val User/NUV Settings:

          Default Flags        - When a user is validated, he will
                                 receive these access flags.
          Daily Flag Change    - Flag changed on first call of each
                                 day. (Format: +FLAGS -FLAGS)
                                 (ie: +ABC-XYZ  - Adds ABC, turns off
                                 XYZ)
          Call Flag Change     - Flag changed on every call.
                                 (Format: +FLAGS -FLAGS)
                                 (ie: +ABC-XYZ  - Adds ABC, turns off
                                 XYZ)


                  SECTION 4: MENUCODE/STATCODE/MAKEPROM/MAKEHELP
                  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

          MENUCODE:

              Before your users can choose from multiple sets of menus,
          you must first code your ansi/ascii menu files into a single
          library file. To do this, you will need the enclosed utility
          MENUCODE.EXE.  The commandline for the code utility is as
          follows.

          MENUCODE <.LIB Name>

          Note: You might want to do this in a separate dir. Also, if a
                file is missing the program will inform you.

               You may be thinking to yourself, What do I name the
          files? The answer is simple. With versions greater than 2.0,
          the SysOp decides which menu(s) will be in each library file.
          Do this by entering an up to 8 letter filename (no extension)
          in the HELP ID field in the menu editor. (Once you've begun
          to edit any menu, HELP ID is on the menu editor change
          screen.) If you do not want an ansi menu coded for a specific
          MNU file that you have, leave the HELP ID blank.

               After all files are successfully coded, copy the *.LIB,
          and *.NDX files to your data directory. Proceed to login to
          the BBS, and enter the main  SysOp menu.  When you've reached
          that, option "N" will allow you to edit your status screens
          or menus. Since you'll be adding menus, select M.

               Option "A" will add a menu set for users to choose from.
          Select this, and fill out the questions. If you do not wish
          to use Library set menus, use the Obv/2 TEXTFILE directory as
          the LIB filename.

          Example:
          Menu Name   : Normal Menus
          Library File: C:\OBV2\TEXTFILE\

          If you take this approach, no LIB/NDX files are necessary.


          STATCODE:

              With the ability to code multiple menu sets, the idea of
          being able to do the same with status screens was invented.
          We call these 'Status Screen Libraries.  Using a small
          utility, called STATCODE, you will be able to code multiple
          statistic screen sets for your users to choose from.

              The status library consists of a few configurable ANSI
          screens, they are as follows:

          NEWSHEAD.ANS  - The News Header
          EMAILHDR.ANS  - Header for E-mail
          HDR.ANS       - The Header
          HEADER.ANS    - Message Header
          ZIPHEAD.ANS   - Internal ZIP Viewer Header (Optional)
          FSEHEAD.ANS   - Header for fullscreen editor
          BCHANGE.ANS   - Base Change Header
          SUBSSRT.ANS   - Sub Listing Start ANSI (Optional)
          SUBSMID.ANS   - Sub Listing Repeat ANSI (Optional)
          SUBSEND.ANS   - Sub Listing End ANSI (Optional)
          AREASRT.ANS   - File Area Listing Start ANSI (Optional)
          AREAMID.ANS   - File Area Listing Repeat ANSI (Optional)
          AREAEND.ANS   - File Area Listing End ANSI (Optional)
          USERSRT.ANS   - User Listing Start ANSI (Optional)
          USERMID.ANS   - User Listing Repeat ANSI (Optional)
          USEREND.ANS   - User Listing End ANSI (Optional)
          STATUS.ANS    - Login Status Screen
          USERSTAT.ANS  - Your Stat ANSI
          FILESTAT.ANS  - File Status
          FCONFIGS.ANS  - File Listing Configuration Screen
          CONFSCR.ANS   - Config Screen
          QWKDN.ANS     - QWK Screen (For creating/downloading QWK)
          QWKUP.ANS     - QWK Screen (For REP upload/message posting)


               It is now possible to code any screen that you want into
          the status library. With the invention of the -N menu command
          (see the menu editor documentation), you may now display
          status screens anywhere in the BBS. To code additional
          screens, create a textfile called *.LST. (ie: If you code
          OBV.LIB, you'll create and OBV.LST) In this textfile, each
          line should have a  valid DOS filename without any path
          information.  When you run STATCODE, make sure to have this
          textfile in the main BBS directory.

               You can also code the data area ansis into your status
          screen libraries. Simply toggle that option on in the CONFIG,
          and place any ansis that have to do with data areas in the
          temp directory that you're using, and run STATCODE. (See the
          section on the data areas on these ansi files)

              As you can see, there are quite a few files that you can
          include in your status screen library.  You'll also notice
          that some of the screens were optional.  Those do NOT have to
          be included in your library, but can be.

          To Code a Status Library:

          1.  Create a temporary directory, copy ALL files to this
              directory.
          2.  Make sure to have your .LST file in the main directory.
          3.  Run STATCODE.EXE with this format: STATCODE <libname>
              <directory>
              ie: STATCODE PMD C:\TEMP\   (No extension on libname!)
          4.  Add the status set with the "N" SysOp command.
          5.  If you coded any of the 3 part listing screens (ie:
              SUBXXXX.ANS, USERXXXX.ANS, or AREAXXXX.ANS) you must
              toggle their use in the CONFIG.  (See the chapter on the
              configuration program on just where to find these
              options.)
          6.  If you coded the data area ansis, make sure that the
              corresponding option is turned on in the CONFIG.


          MAKEPROM:

               With the new-and-improved string system in version 2.00
          and greater, there is no more need for a string compiler.
          Instead, we've written a new utility called MAKEPROM which
          will add/arrange any new strings. No textfiles, no compilers,
          nothing but a simple executable file.

               This utility will add any new strings to the data file,
          and will arrange them in their specific order. Do not run
          this program more than on time per new version. The program
          will inform you which prompts it can convert, and all you
          need to do is run it once to update your PROMPTS.DAT.

          MAKEHELP:

               With the new configuration system in version 2.0 and
          greater, we've created a help system. This system will give
          the SysOp a brief description of each option. Whenever new
          options are added to the config, new descriptions must be
          added to the data file. MAKEHELP will update your help file.
          Run this only once per new version, just like MAKEPROM.


                        SECTION 5: DATA AREA CONFIGURATION
                        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The data area is a new outlook on an old idea. This data
          area system draws on the old database system found in some
          BBS softwares. This system takes the good features of the
          database, and combines them with the configurability of
          Oblivion/2.

               Data areas can be used for a few very practical
          applications. We've already utilized these areas in making a
          BBS list, Rumors, and One Liners. All of these are completely
          SysOp configurable, and can be altered in any way the SysOp
          chooses.

               To show the configurability of the data areas, I will
          demonstrate making a BBS listing, along with explaining how
          these data areas work.

               When you first enter the data area sysop menu, you'll be
          presented with a few self-explanatory options. (Add, delete,
          change, quit.) Since we're just starting out, we'll select
          add. You'll be presented with the following screen:


          (A) Area Name      : BBS List
          (B) Access ACS     :
          (C) Add ACS        :
          (D) List Prefix    : BBS
          (E) Add Ansi       : ADDBBS.ANS
          (F) Sponsor        : Lord Tracer
          (G) Allow Anonymous: No
          (H) Store Message  : Yes
          (I) Data File Name : BBSLIST
          (J) Show Ansi      : SHOWBBS.ANS
          (K) AutoDelete     : 0
          (L) Directory      :
          (M) Node Number    :


          Area name          - Name of the data area. In our case, this
                               will be BBS list.
          Access ACS         - ACS required to access this data area.
          Add ACS            - ACS required to add an option. In this
                               case, it would be adding your BBS entry.
          List Prefix        - This prefix (up to 5 letters) tells the
                               BBS the name of the 3-part listing file
                               to use. Using BBS, the 3 ansis you'd
                               need to make would be BBSSRT.ANS,
                               BBSMID.ANS, and BBSEND.ANS. (See the
                               section on making 3 part repeat ansis
                               for help with this)
          Add Ansi           - The ANSI that appears when the user
                               wants to add to the database. In this
                               case, this ansi could be a box with BBS
                               name, number etc. Each of these options
                               requires an MCI code. Worry about that
                               later. (If you use %xx as your MCI codes
                               instead of |xx, the BBS will force input.)
          Sponsor            - The user that can edit the database. If
                               you want to give specific users their
                               own database, you do not need to give
                               them SysOp access to edit their
                               database.
          Allow Anonymous    - Can the user add to this database
                               anonymously? If so, set this to yes.
          Store Message      - Can this database store an ANSI file or
                               description for each entry? If so,
                               change this to yes.  In our case, we
                               wish to allow the SysOp to upload his
                               BBS ad, or write a description.
          Data filename      - This is the filename the BBS uses to
                               store information about this database.
                               Do not include an extension.
          Show Ansi          - This ansi is displayed when the user
                               views one of the data listings. In this
                               example, you'd want to give a lot of
                               information in the Show Ansi. Stuff that
                               you didn't put in the listing ansi.
                               Again, you'll use MCI codes for this
                               ansi, worry about what codes to use
                               later.
          Autodelete         - This number is the maximum number of
                               entries in one database. Entries will be
                               auto-purged to stay below this number.
          Directory          - Like message bases, data areas can also
                               be echoed with Obv/2's DATAMAIL.EXE
                               utility. This directory stores the *.MSG
                               files that contain the information to
                               network for the current data area.
          Node Number        - Enter the node number assigned to you by
                               your network admin. Make sure to enter
                               the node number of the net that supports
                               networked data areas. (IE: If you're in
                               ImpactNet, and you want to net BBS lists
                               with the ImpactNet SysOps, don't put
                               your Cybercrime node number)


               After you've completed the configuration of the data
          area, press q to quit. The BBS will ask you "Edit Options?"
          Select yes. In this section, there are 3 options:

          Name          : BBS Name
          String Length : 40
          MCI Code      : BN

               Enter every piece of information that you want to prompt
          the user. (You should use all of these MCI codes in your add
          ansi. Use the important ones in your listing ansi, and
          finally, all of them in your show Ansi. See the example BBS
          list provided with the BBS.)

               Taking a look at the above example, the name of the
          field is BBS name, you can enter up to 40 characters for this
          field, and the MCI code for your ansis is |BN. Notice that
          you do NOT put the | in the editor! Just BN!

               The data areas require a little work to create, but when
          you put in the effort, and understand how it works, the
          results are pleasing.

               With v2.20 and later, you can network your data areas.
          This is done just like networking a message base. You'll need
          an import/export directory, and a node number. The
          import/export directory stores the message files, and the
          node number tells the tosser which network it's tossing.

               You can only run DATAMAIL.EXE in a network that supports
          the networked data areas. Once you've found a network that
          does this, you'll just use your node #, and then a dir on
          your HD. Set this up JUST like a message base. Go into your
          tosser program, and add this area into the listing.  You'll
          be given more information by your network admin. on exactly
          how to set it up.



                           SECTION 6: CONFERENCE EDITOR
                           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

              With the conferencing system, there can be up to 255
          separated message and file conferences.  Also with the system
          comes many security features to prevent unwanted users in
          your conferences.

              The Conference Manager is located in the main SysOp menu.
          Upon entering, you will be asked whether you wish to edit a
          message or a file conference. Select the appropriate option.
          You will be taken to the main menu of the manager. It looks a
          bit like this:


           Add Conference      Edit Conference
           Delete Conference   Change Type
           Users w/Access      Reorder
           List                Quit



          Add/Edit/Delete/List        - These are quite self-
                                        explanatory.
          Reorder                     - Will allow you to change the
                                        order of your conferences.
                                        (ie: Making Conference 2 into
                                        Conference 1)
          Users with Access           - This command will display a
                                        listing of all users that have
                                        access to the conference.

              When you wish to add/edit a conference, you are presented
          with the following:

          Description    :  Oblivion/2 Support
          ACS            :  S25
          Conference ID  :  1
          Password       :

          Description        -  This is the name of the current
                                conference.
          ACS                -  This is the ACS required to enter the
                                conference.
          Password           -  This is the password required to enter
                                the conference.
          Conference ID      -  This number is used internally by
                                Oblivion/2 to tell the BBS which
                                conference is which. You must use this
                                number when working with the JT, and JF
                                menu commands. It's also used in the
                                sub/file area listing when you don't
                                use repeat method screens.

                        SECTION 7: SYSOP ONLINE FUNCTIONS
                        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               Oblivion/2 v2.0 was designed specifically with the SysOp
          in mind. There are a few global SysOp commands that can be
          accessed via the local terminal. You can also get a listing
          of these keys by pressing ALT-H from within the program.

          F4     - Scrollback Buffer
          F5     - Screen Image
          F6     - Toggles on/off logging of text typed in the chat
          F9     - Input Lockout (Locks incoming data from modem)
          F10    - Output Lockout (Locks BBS output to modem)

          ALT-X  - Access to all file areas
          ALT-T  - Temporary SysOp access
          ALT-J  - SysOp Shell to DOS
          ALT-V  - Validate user
          ALT-Q  - Displays KICKOFF.ANS in textfile directory, and
                   drops carrier on user

          Commandline parameters for OBV.EXE:

          -B xxxxx  : Pass xxxxx baud rate to OBV.EXE
          -E        : Forced event run
          -A        : Return to DOS after user hangs up
          -D        : BBS doesn't check for work/swap directories
          -L        : Local Login (Logs in as SysOp from DOS prompt)
          -N x      : Load up node x
          -EMS      : Loads OVR (Overlay) into EMS memory
          -MENU     : Loads menu editor from DOS
          -USER     : Loads user editor from DOS
          -PROMPTS  : Loads string editor from DOS
          -CONFIG   : Loads CONFIG program from DOS
          -T xxxx   : xxxx = time in minutes after midnight before which
                      users should be kicked off. (ie: -T 120 means that
                      users will be kicked off until 2:00am)
          -M xxxx   : xxxx = number of minutes until the next event
                      before which users should be kicked off. (ie: -M 120
                      and an event of 7:00pm would mean that users cannot
                      access the BBS from the hours of 5:00pm until 7:00pm)
          -D        : Overrides the current swap directory setting. (In
                      case you made a mistake in entering the directory,
                      this command will allow you to enter the BBS and
                      change the bad swap directory name.)



                                   EVENT EDITOR
                                   ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               One of the many great features of Oblivion/2 is its
          powerful event editing system. With the internal event
          editor, you're able to perform most any daily maintainence
          you wish, toggle SysOp availability, and much more. There are
          four basic types of events. They are:

          Errorlevel  - BBS exits at a certain errorlevel to run batch
                        files.
          Code        - Executes one or more menu commands with full
                        CString support.
          Availability- Toggles on/off SysOp availability.
          User ACS    - Allows you to define ACS required to login to
                        the BBS at certain times.

               Errorlevel events are ones in which the BBS will exit at
          an errorlevel of your choice, and run a batch file, or other
          program of your choice. To make the BBS run a batch file, you
          need to add statements to your batch file that runs the BBS.
          They will look similar to this:

          If errorlevel xx then runme.bat  (Use batch knowledge)

          Define your errorlevel, and replace xx with that level.
          Assign a time for this event, and away it goes.

          This is an example of a batch file that runs the BBS, and
          can be used in an errorlevel event.

          @ECHO OFF
          if errorlevel 100 then speedisk
          if errorlevel 255 then exit
          :BBS
          OBV.EXE
          :SPEEDISK
          cd\norton
          SPEEDISK.EXE /BATCH C:
          cd\obv2
          goto obv
          :exit
          exit

               As you can see, the errorlevel event is Norton Utilities
          Speedisk. The batch file was written to run speedisk when
          the BBS exits with errorlevel 100. It then re-loads the BBS
          when the program is done executing. Use this as a basis for
          other events you may wish to add in.

               Code events are probably the most useful. They allow you
          to perform certain menu commands with full CString support at
          any hour of the day. The uses for this are endless. One
          example is packing the Email. This should be done often to
          keep the Email system quick. To do this, add a 'Code' event
          that runs the Command Keys "EZ". Assign a time for it, and
          away it goes.

               SysOp availability is toggled through the event editor.
          You can toggle when the SysOp is in/out by using this event
          type. Select Availability event, and toggle whether it is to
          be when the SysOp is available or not. Assign a time, and
          thats it.

               The final event type is User ACS. This event type is
          used to restrict BBS logins to certain ACS requirements. For
          example, you can make it so that only user 20 can log into
          the system at 5:00am to 6:00am. Add a User ACS event, and
          make the ACS "U20" (No "" marks). Add 5:00 am as the start
          time, and 6:00 am for the end time. Simple as that.

               The commandline switch -E is used to execute your events
          if you're running FD. When running any type of mailer,
          chances are that the BBS will miss its events. If the time
          has already passed (Say you've got an event scheduled to pack
          the message bases at 2:00am), Obv/2 will run that 2:00am
          event. (Only if its past 2:00am)


                                   DELETED LIST
                                   ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The deleted list is like an improved blacklist. It gives
          you much more control over who gets on the system, and who
          stays off, and for how long. Here's how it works.

               When you want to delete someone, he can optionally be
          tossed into this deleted list. When inside of the list, there
          are 3 types of deletions:

               Immediate: File displayed to user, Then he's off the
                          blacklist, and can re-apply.
              Expiration: File displayed to user until date specified.
                          After date specified, user is off deleted
                          list.
                   Never: File displayed to user. Permanantly on the
                          blacklist.

               If you noticed above, each level of deletion displays a
          file to the user. When you add a user, you can change the
          blacklist file for each one. This lets you put 'personal'
          messages to your blacklisted users. The default is
          BLACKLST.ANS. If you want to change the filename, enter
          a different one when the BBS prompts you for a filename.


                                  STRING EDITOR
                                  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               With new versions of Oblivion/2, string editing has
          become much easier. You no longer need to compile your
          strings, the BBS will do it all for you.

               This new version now has an online string editor. Some
          features include: strings of up to 255 characters, being able
          to use filenames in place of strings, and customized
          variables for displaying BBS information in your strings.

               Moving around in the editor is quite simple. Press [,]
          to view 5 more strings. When you see a string that you wish
          to edit, press that strings corresponding number. The BBS
          will then allow you to edit that string on the lower half of
          the screen. You may use CTRL-V to toggle insert mode, and use
          CTRL-U as an ascii chart. (Use the cursor to pick the upper
          ASCII character you want, and it will be printed in the
          cursor's current position in your string).

               Notice that when you see your strings, you'll see 2
          lines for each string. The upper line is what the string
          description is, and the lower line is what you've configured
          that string to be.

               You may use |Ux (1-6) for each of the six user colors.
          You can also use |01-15 to force a certain color. |OT, and
          |O2 are internal variable MCI codes that the BBS uses to
          place information. If you see one of the prompts with a |OT,
          or |O2, make sure that your string also has one.

               Another approach to string editing is filenames. You can
          have the BBS print a file instead of a string. This comes in
          handy for places where you just need to put more information.
          For example, you might want to configure your message reading
          string, or file newscanning string to use a textfile. This is
          a simple process. Create your ANSI, and place it into your
          textfile directory. Use %%FILENAME.EXT for that string in
          your editor. This will force the BBS to read that string from
          the file. In this external file, you may use 3 percent codes:
          %IN, %OT, and %O2. %IN tells the BBS where to place the
          cursor after the screen has been drawn. Use this to place
          user input anywhere you want. The input color will be the
          same as the color that you use with %IN. Like above %OT, and
          %O2 are information placers.  Only use them if the original
          string has them.

               A new code has been added to let the string pause for a
          return. This string is |PA. When you add this anywhere in
          your string, you'll be paused until the user hits return.

               You should run the Oblivion/2 Utility MAKEPROM.EXE when
          you are instructed to by us. This updates your prompts
          automatically. It saves a lot of time, and is better than the
          old PROMPTS.TXT way of doing things. Make sure not to run the
          program more than one time, as it could lead to damage of
          your string file!

                                MENU PROMPT EDITOR
                                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The menu prompt editor allows you to configure many
          different prompts, and have your users choose which one they
          like. These prompts can range from something simple like
          this:

          Main Menu:

          to something more extravagant:

          [10:06 pm EST]
          [Main Menu] [?/Help]:

               The operations of this editor are quite self-
          explanatory. When making menu prompts, you'll be in the
          Fullscreen editor. There are several MCI codes that you'll be
          able to use in your prompts.

          |01-|15 : ANSI colors from 01-15
          |MN     : Menu Name (Name in prompt in Menu editor)
          |TL     : Time Left
          |TM     : Time Now
          |FLxx   : Sets input length to xx
          |RC     : Regular Color
          |SC     : Status Color
          |PC     : Prompt Color
          |EC     : Input Color
          |VC     : Inverse Color
          |XC     : Box Color
          |Ux     : Moves up x amount of lines
          |Dx     : Moves down x amount of lines
          |Fx     : Moves forward x spaces
          |Bx     : Moves backward x spaces
          |Xxx    : Moves to absolute X value. ie: |X10 moves to the
                    10th row
          |NN     : Displays Node Number

          SysOps may place %%filename.ext anywhere in the menu prompt
          to display filename.ext from the prompts directory. Use the
          %MN code to display the Menu's Name in Prompt (in filename.ext).
          Set the Prompts directory in the CONFIG.

                                 PROTOCOL EDITOR
                                 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               With version 2.xx of Oblivion/2, protocol editing has
          been made much easier. All protocol setup is done internally.

               When you first enter the protocol editor. You'll be
          asked which type of protocols you want to edit. There's four
          types of protocols: Single File, Batch, Resume, and
          Bidirectional.  Single File protocols (both upload and
          download) are used in sending QWK Packets, Receiving REP
          Packets, Receiving Filemail, Sending Memorized Messages,
          Sending Complete File Lists, etc.  Batch Protocols are the
          heart of the file system. Resume Protocols are used to let a
          user resume an uncompleted upload. (Only some protocols
          support this, DSZ, MPT, HS-Link are a few examples)

               Once you've selected which type of protocol you want to
          edit, you'll be placed in an Oblivion/2 Box editor. The
          options available from this screen are: Description, Key,
          Program Name, and Commandline. Description is the description
          you want to give the protocol. (ie: Zmodem Mobyturbo). Key is
          the KEY that users must press to activate that protocol. (for
          Zmodem, this could be Z). Program Name is the protocol
          executable itself. (For Zmodem, DSZ.COM, or GSZ.EXE) Finally,
          the commandline options are to be placed in the commandline
          string. (See the DSZ documentation for the best string to
          use)

                                 PARAMETER EDITOR
                                 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The parameter editor is a quick and easy way of
          utilizing levels. What the editor does is allow you to define
          a level (lets say 50), and let you give that level certain
          PCR, UD, UD K, Time, DL K PER DAY ratios, and various
          expiration values.

               To use the editor, just create a level (say 50). Then,
          enter in level 50's PCR, UD, UD K, TIME and DL K PER DAY
          ratios/values. Now, when someone's given level 50 from the
          user editor, they'll get these specified amounts.

               You can now also specify a # of days til expiration, and
          the level that the user will receive when his account expires
          for each level in your parameter editor.

               The unique feature of this Paramater editor is that it
          can be totally invisible to the SysOp if he/she desires. In
          your CONFIG, under 'Validated User Levels' there are a few
          'Default XXXX level' entries. Should you wish to use the
          parameter editor, change those values from whatever they may
          be to zero. (Do this only for the Default UD, UD K, DL K per
          day, Time etc. Do not change Average CPS to 0). When the
          value is Zero, it tells Obv/2 to read from the parameter
          editor values. Should you wish not to use this editor, change
          the values to whatever you wish. The parameter editor will
          have no function.

               If you want to change a certain field for a certain
          user, it's simple. Say you wanted to give Joe User 30 minutes
          instead of 15 mins. (Say level 50 had 15 mins in it). You'd
          then go to the user editor. Option 'time left' should be
          changed to 30. Thats it.

               Please note, in the user editor, DL K per DAY, Time, UD,
          UD K, and PCR must all be zero. The parameter system will
          only look at those values in the parameter editor if the
          values for the above, in the user editor, are zero. There is
          a function in the editor which allows you to Zero-Out certain
          levels of users, so that they can follow the parameters. Also
          note that the default CONFIG levels must also be zero for the
          parameter editor to take effect. If they're not, the
          parameter editor will not function correctly.


                                   USER EDITOR
                                   ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The user editor in 2.xx has been completely overhauled.
          It's now completely batch oriented, and allows for many new
          options. A few of these include Infoform Extraction,
          Searching, Quick Loading of Users, Highlight Selected User
          Editing and more.

               When you first select the user edit option, you'll be
          asked 'Edit Individual' If you pick yes, the BBS will prompt
          you to enter a username. If you select no, the BBS will clear
          screen, and print 23 user names, and let you select them with
          a highlight bar. Hit "Q" to quit that process, or RETURN to
          select the highlighted user.

               Once inside the editor, you'll find a myriad of
          configurable options. Note a few important keys: [,] move to
          the previous/next user. {,} move to the previous/next user in
          your search link. * extracts the selected Infoform to a file.
          Finally, S takes you into the Search Editor. It looks like
          this:

          (H) Handle String  : [OFF]
          (A) ACS            : [OFF]
          (L) Level          : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (F) File Level     : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (D) Days Since 1st : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (S) Days Since Last: [OFF] - [OFF]
          (E) Flag           : [OFF]
          (N) Number of Calls: [OFF] - [OFF]
          (Y) Age            : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (G) Gender         : [OFF]
          (P) PCR            : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (U) % U/D Ratio    : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (K) % U/D K Ratio  : [OFF] - [OFF]
          (X) Expiration Date: [OFF] - [OFF]
          (T) Tabulate Search

               This unique editor allow you to have the BBS search for
          specific users, using your search criteria, and let you edit
          all of them easily. This makes manual changes a breeze.

               The options above are pretty self-explanatory. Make sure
          to press "T" to 'Tabulate Search' If you don't, your search
          won't run, and you'll lose your search criteria.

               When in the user editor, use the {,} keys for quick
          backward/forward progress in your search editing.

                               SECTION 8: INFOFORMS
                               ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               Infoforms are a sysop's easy way of keeping information
          about his users. Usually, when you login to a BBS, you'll be
          asked to fill out forms. Sometimes forms are used as
          applications to groups or whatnot. None the less, they are
          very useful in storing information.

              Making Ansi or Ascii infoforms is quite simple. For Ascii
          infoforms create your ascii file with questions, and using
          Qedit or any similar text editor use one of these following
          characters depending on what you wish to do:

          *    -- Waits for a response. (Abortable)
          |Xx  -- Limits User input to xx spaces.
          %xx  -- Accepts up to xx characters, and will repeat
                  the question if the user leaves it blank.
          @    -- Gets input similar to *. It will repeat the
                  the question if the user leaves it blank.

               You have space for 5 information forms. After you've
          created your ANSI/ASCII infoform, name it INFOFORM.1 through
          INFOFORM.5. INFOFORM.5 is the form used by New User Voting.
          If you want NUV, make sure to put the appropriate form in
          INFOFORM.5.

               You can force users to fill out certain infoforms by
          making them mandatory in the CONFIG. Users must fill those
          forms out in their login in order to gain access to the
          system.

               You can clear your infoforms by using the Clear Infoform
          command from the SysOp menu. If you have altered your
          infoform, it's a good idea to clear out your infoforms
          because the answers could end up in the wrong spots.

               New with version 2.20, you can now have multiple infoform
          sets. Instead of letting users fill out only 5 forms, you can
          have an unlimited amount of infoforms. The default 5 infoforms
          are stored in a data file called INFOFORM . To have more than 5
          forms, you can change the file that the infoforms are stored in.
          The user editor, and the -) menu command allow you to change the
          data file to another name. Each new data file stores 5 new infoforms
          for each user.


                          SECTION 9: MAKING REPEAT ANSIs
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

          In an effort to add more configurability to Obv/2, we've
          created the 'Repeat Method' of making ANSI screens.  These
          screens are used all around the BBS. Some areas include:
          Message base/File Area Listings, One Liners, Rumors, User
          Listing, Last Caller Listing, BBS Listing and more. It's
          important that you learn how these work. Please read
          carefully.

          In the repeat method, there are 3 screens for each type of
          listing.  The first, an intro, the second is the actual way
          to repeat, and the 3rd is an ending.

          For example, to make a messge base listing that looked like
          this:


          Base         Description                             Network
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
          1            General Talk                           ImpactNet
          2            BBS Advertisements                     ImpactNet
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

          The 3 files used in message base listing are:

          SUBSSRT.ANS  - Intro to listing
          SUBSMID.ANS  - Middle (This uses MCI codes, and is the one
                         that will be repeated)
          SUBSEND.ANS  - The end of the listing.


          Our SUBSTART.ANS would look like this:

          Base         Description                             Network
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

          Our SUBSMID.ANS would look like this:

          |AN          |BN                                     |NN

          Our SUBSEND.ANS would look like this:

          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               As you can see, the repeat ansi is one of the most powerful
          features of Oblivion/2.  Due to several bugs in TheDraw and
          missing features in the ANSI.SYS device, you need to make a
          few manual changes to  the middle part before they will work
          properly. (Middle part = xxxxxMID.ANS)

               Load TheDraw and draw your ansi. When done, enter
          animation mode using top rescan (others may work, but this is
          standard).  Place the appropiate MCI codes and save the ansi.
          (If you are doing a plain non-animated ansi, save it as a
          block. Note that this cannot be done with animated screens).

               Exit TheDraw, and run ANSITRAN on it. ANSITRAN is a
          utility supplied with the Oblivion/2 package, and is supposed
          to clean the ANSI saved in TheDraw from unwanted escape
          codes.  Mostly it makes a good job of this, but since you are
          going to edit your ANSI anyways, you might as well double-
          check.

               To do this, load your finished ANSI into QEdit or a
          similar ASCII based text-editor. The strings ANSITRAN looks
          for are esc[255D and esc[Aesc[B (the two codes together like
          that or esc[Besc[A). If you see them, remove them.

               The important part in making your repeat ANSI work, is
          to replace any esc[yy;xxH codes with esc[;xxH.  This is
          because ANSI.SYS doesnt support going to XXth column in
          current row, and thus TheDraw doesn't add that code in.
          According to the ANSI 3.64-1979 standard esc[;xxH should go
          to XXth column in first row, however Oblivion/2 interprets
          the code differently in middle repeat ansis (and only middle
          in the repeat ansis).  Instead of going to XXth column in
          first row, it will go to XXth column in current row, thus
          making repeat ANSIs possible.

               Having completed this, your repeat ansi is ready for
          use.  It may take a while to become familiar with the ANSI
          codes, but after a while you learn them and this procedure
          will be mere routine.


               An example of a middle repeat ansi, created for the
          oneliners follows below.  This example repeat ansi would look
          like this:

          "Û Here goes your oneliners...                Column 80 -> Û"

          This is how TheDraw saved the animated middle ansi I just
          made:

           [255D [0B [255D [0;1;30mÛ [78CÛ [2C [1A [0;32m|ON [0m

               We remove the esc[255D's and notice the esc[0B. It moves
          the cursor 0 chars down, so we can remove that too. The
          esc[78C moves the cursor 78 spaces to the right, we could
          also have done this using esc[;80H, thus moving the cursor to
          a fixed position in column 80. This is quite useful in some
          cases, and it makes it easier to recognize what is being
          done. After editing, it now looks like this:

           [0;1;30mÛ [78CÛ [2C [1A [0;32m|ON [0m

               Here's what it does: esc[0;1;30m equals the three ansi
          codes esc[0m, esc[1m, and esc[30m, color manipulations.
          Stacking commands using semicolon is used very often, and can
          be done as long as the last letter of the command (in this
          case m) is the same. Next, it puts a Û at position one, moves
          79 spaces to the right and dumps another one Û, wordwrapping
          onto the next line. Then it goes two more spaces to the
          right, and one line up, fixing out location at column 3.
          Cursor color is set to dark green.  The MCI code will be
          replaced by your oneliner when this is shown. At last, the
          colors are reset so as not to interfere with your next ansi.

          And this is already a working repeat ansi!  If you'd rather
          use the esc[;xxH code, it'd look like this:

           [0;1;30mÛ [;80HÛ [;3H [2;32m|ON [0m

          I prefer this one myself, but both will work in this case.

              As you can see, the system is very easy to use, and is
          very versatile. Please note that each screen type has certain
          MCI codes that go with it. Only in Data Areas can you define
          your own MCI codes. These are as follows:

               With versions after v2.20, you must be careful with your
          xxxxMID.ANS files. They must not be over 16K. If they are,
          there will be certain problems. Some screens cannot even be
          16K, those screens will be noted as they are listed.

                        SECTION 10: MAKING STANDARD ANSIS
                        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

              When making the animated statistic screens, such as a new
          Main User Stat screen, a few simple rules must be followed.
          Screens should be made in this manner to insure that they
          will work correctly with Oblivion/2.

              These are the instructions to make a non-animated status
          screen. Animated Status screens require a bit more work and
          will require maintenance if they are not correctly made.

          To make Stat Screens w/o Complex Animations, follow these
          steps:

          1] Draw Basic Screen.
          2] Put Thedraw into ANIMATION Mode. And when prompted to
             select scanning method, use "TOP" (Others may work, but
             this is standard.)
          3] Add the Appropriate MCI Codes, some external screens use
             the |xx codes and others use the %xx codes. Make sure you
             use the right ones.
          4] After you've finished adding the MCI Codes, Save Animation
             in Ansi file format.  Select Clear Screen, and Maximum
             line length to 255.  Again, other numbers work, but this
             is standard.

              If your MCI codes seem out of place (ie: The stat isn't
          showing up where I put the MCI code for it), this could be
          one of two things.

          1] |xx codes were used instead of %xx and vice versa.
          2] Thedraw has expanded the MCI codes and Oblivion/2 cannot
             recognize them.

              If you used the right type of MCI codes, chances are that
          your problem is #2.  Thedraw has a nasty habit of expanding
          MCI codes to more than 3 letters, therefore making them
          unrecognizable to Oblivion/2.  There is a solution to this,
          ANSITRAN.EXE was written by Darkened Enmity to combat this
          problem. It is included in the distribution ZIP.  Here
          are the instructions for using this utility:

          1] Save ANSI in 80 character per line mode. With whatever
             preparation you've previously chosen.
          2] Run ANSITRAN filename to correct the MCI bug.


          Another Screen that requires Attention is CONFSCR.ANS

              Use the appropriate |xx codes for this screen, but there
          is a difference in this screen than in others. When making
          your ansi, you MUST make the Color Bar.  Use Ansi Block
          Characters to make the bar.  ALL COLORS 0-15 must be in this
          bar if you want it to work correctly.  After you have
          made the main ansi with the color bar, put it into Top Scan
          Animation. Add the |xx codes.  When you are adding the |CB
          code (|CB is color bar), put this code OVER the Black on
          Black Box.  It will look a bit like this.

          0123456789ABCDE  (You'll have boxes, numbers are used only
                            for example)

          |CB go right over 0,1, and 2.

          An example will be provided for you.

                          SECTION 12: CONFIGURABLE CHAT
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

              Configurable Chat was added to allow for more
          configuration for the SysOp, therefore making his board
          different than anybody else's.  You can make horizontal split
          screen chats, vertical ones, diagonal ones, or anything that
          pops into your head. To make a chat follow the following
          instructions:

          1] Create the design for your chat, name this CHATDEF.ANS
             It will be placed in the TEXTFILE directory when you're
             all done.
          2] Put CHATDEF.ANS into Animation Mode, and use TOP Scan.
          3] You must now create the "Margins" for the SysOp side of
             the chat, and the user's side of the chat.  To do this,
             you'll need some MCI codes.  For the left border of each
             line of the SysOp's side, You use ^xx, and for the right
             margin of the SysOp's type, use &xx.  Do the same for the
             user side. Here are the codes for the user side, `xx for
             the left, and ~xx for the right margin.  These MCI codes
             will tell Oblivion/2 where to wordwrap each line. Here is
             an example Horizontal Split Screen Chat (Non-animated, of
             course). This will help you to get the idea of what you
             must do.

          ^01                                                      &01
          ^02                                                      &02
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ|SNÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄSplit Screen ChatÄÄÄ|UNÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
          `01                                                      ~01
          `02                                                      ~02

              As you can see, the start MCI code will tell the program
          where to start typing, and the end MCI code will tell the
          program where to wordwrap.  If you notice, the xx has been
          replaced by numbers.  Each line must have a number, so Line
          01 will wordwrap onto Line 02. So, don't mix up the numbers
          or you'll have a REAL MESS! If you notice in the example, the
          end MCI codes have been placed right at the end of the line.
          This is because the wordwrap starts where the MCI code
          starts. Placing them as they are above will prevent any
          problems that could arise.  Place them in that fashion when
          you make your own.  Another thing to notice is the |SN and
          |UN. |SN is the MCI code for the SysOp Name, and |UN is the
          pipe code for the current user name.  These are NOT required
          in your screen. So if you want to play some kind of game with
          the user, you can do that too.

             This is an example of a vertical chat screen, if you want
          to do one of those instead of the horizontal shown above:

          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ|SNÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ|UNÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
          ^01                          &01`01                      ~01
          ^02                          &02`02                      ~02
          ^03                          &03`03                      ~03
          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

             In the user side, the lines `01, `02, `03 should be one
          space to the left. This will become obvious when you animate
          the screen in thedraw. The reason being that the user's type
          starts at the `xx code. You want to give the user the most
          typing he can get, so you want to start close to the middle
          line.

             Notice the SysOp side. Look at the &xx codes. Notice where
          I put them. The SysOp's type will end on the space where the
          &xx begins. To give the SysOp maximum typing, I put the codes
          right over the middle line. Remember, you won't overwrite this
          line because you'll animate the codes in using TheDraw.


          4] Save the Screen, and use the ANSITRAN.EXE utility if it
             doesn't show up properly.  See the docs of ANSITRAN for
             more info.

               There are a few options that SysOps and users can use in
          the chat mode:

          /TYPE - Allows the SysOp to type any file in the textfile
                  directory.
          /PAGE - In one line chat, /PAGE will page the SysOp. In split
                  screen chat, /PAGE will page the user.

                                   Introduction


               Oblivion/2 2.0 Menu Editor.  This is, in my opinion, the
          best feature ever offered in any BBS software.  The menu
          editor will allow you to modify, customize, or make a totaly
          unique menu system for your BBS.

               The Menu Editor is a very simple yet uses a complex
          system of commands that can be used individualy or stacked.
          The commands can be restricted to access levels, flags,
          conferences, age, and a variety other levels.

               Due to the fact that just about everything in Oblivion/2
          2.0 can be configured via the Menu Editor, it's pretty much
          impossible for us to show you examples of how to use every
          command (Not to mention I doubt anybody would actuly print 25
          meg of documentation). Instead we've put together a few
          samples of what can be done, and a descriptive list of all
          the available commands.  After that is's up to you and your
          imagination.  Have fun with it & take your time.

          Command Key: FG
          Function   : Custom File Operations
          CString    : Operation Name, batchfile

          This function is used to add functions not supported by
          Oblivion/2 into your file sections. The command works via
          a batchfile that you create. The custom file operations
          command will generate a list of files in the user's batch que
          with pathnames. This file is called FILELST. It will be found
          in the work directory. The 'operation name' part of the
          CString is the name of this operation. It will be displayed
          to users in the format of 'Enter up to 50 files to (Operation
          Name Here)' (Just like the rest of the file section does).
          The batchfile will then tell the BBS which DOS commands to
          execute to perform your operation. An example setup of this
          command is as follows. Say that you have an artwork oriented
          board, and you leave the ansis uncompressed on your HD. You
          want to let the users ZIP up all the ANSI files they want to
          download into one ZIP file for easier downloading. Say you
          want to call this operation 'Zip up'. This is the command in
          the menu editor you'd use.

          Command Key: FG
          CString    : Zip Up,ZIP.BAT

          ZIP.BAT would look like this:
          C:\OBV\PKZIP.EXE %1ZIPDANSI.ZIP @%FILELST.

          When executed, it would look like this:
          C:\OBV\PKZIP.EXE C:\OBV\WORK\ZIPDANSI.ZIP @C:\OBV\WORK\FILELST.

                              Oblivion/2 Menu Editor
          -------------------------------------------------------------

               Oblivion/2's Menu Editor is much like Telegard /
          Renegade's Menu editing system.  There are some expanded
          functions that should be known.

          The main menu editing interface consists of 9 commands.
          A sample of the interface is shown below. (Scaled down)

               (A) The first command is plain and simple... The name of
                   the menu. It is there for the user's reference.
               (B) A Password for the menu can be specified.
               (C) A Fallback menu.  This is the menu that will be used
                   as a return of fallback.  If no fallback is
                   specified, then the system will make the last menu
                   in the stack as the default fallback.
               (D) This is the ID for the file to be hardcoded when
                   Menu Libraries are coded. (ie: MAIN = MAIN.ANS in a
                   menu LIB file)
               (E) Menu Title To Be Displayed in the menu prompt.
               (F) (Reserved) There may be utilities that may use them
                   such as ones that will generate generic menus that
                   look half-way decent. That is if anyone gets around
                   to writing the utility.
               (G) Pulldown Ansi.  This option will be explained
                   further in the documentation.
               (H) Allows Editing of the menu's actual options
               (I) Displays a generic menu.

                  Most of these options are pretty much self
                  explanitory, so if you don't understand what one does
                  - experiment.



          -------------------------------------------------------------
                  (H) Edit Options.  The following is a sample screen
                      of the option editor.

               From this menu there isn't all that much to do.  You
          can simply add, delete, move, or change menu
          functions.


               To Edit an option, hit C then the option number.

                   (A) Option Name - Name Of the option the way you
                       want it displayed in a generic menu.  (This is
                       also used in a pulldown menu.  SEE Pullown Menus
                       for more)
                   (B) ACS - Access Level, Flag, or other restriction
                       to use for this option.
                   (C) Hidden - Determines if the option name will be
                       displayed in a generic menu.  (This is also used
                       in pulldown menus)
                   (D) Command Keys - The actual Command that will be
                       executed.
                   (E) Keys - this is the key, or keys used to execute
                       the command. You can put FIRSTCMD to execute the
                       command when the user goes to the menu or EACH
                       to do it before the prompt is drawn, every time
                       the user is at the menu.
                   (F) Command String - Some commands will allow the
                       use of a command string.  See each command for a
                       command string(s) if any.
                   (G) Pulldown ID - This is used in pulldown menus.
                       (SEE Pulldown Menus for more)

          -------------------------------------------------------------

          In the Pulldown Filename, there can be the following:

          <blank>
            Draws Menu Prompt with the name in the prompt in the prompt
            and does standard input

          ::X
            Where X is a letter in the alphabet. Randomly picks a
            letter from A to X, and will act as if the user pressed
            that key.

            Example: Random Matrices
            The above command can be used to easily make random
            matrices. Say that you have 4 matrices that you want to
            randomize. Since D is the 4th letter of the alphabet, your
            pulldown filename will be ::D. (Without the period) In your
            MATRIX.MNU, you'll have need to have four commands with the
            'Key' Field set to A,B,C,D. Now, for each command, you'll
            want it to go to a different menu. That new menu will be
            one of your matrices. Here's an example of one command that
            you'll have in the MATRIX.MNU.

          Description : Go to DOS Matrix
          Hidden      : No
          Command Keys: -^   (GOTO Menu)
          Key         : A
          CString     : DOSMAT

            Do the same thing for the other 3 letters. Note that you
            can't have other commands in the menu as they won't be
            executed. Only commands that will be executed will be the
            ones with the keys A-D.

          N
            Writes the Name in the Prompt alone

              May Contain:

                  ^R - Regular Color      ^S - Status Color
                  ^P - Prompt Color       ^E - Input Color
                  ^V - Inverse Color      ^X - Box Color
                  ^M - Goes down a line

              Using The Following To End:
                  / Yes/No Bar Prompt beginning with No
                  \ Yes/No Bar Prompt beginning with Yes
                  = Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with Yes
                  | Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with No
                  @ Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with Quit
                  * Inputs String
                  : Inputs String with a : in a different color
                  # Hotkey without Echo
                  ) Hotkey with Echo
                  ( Sets the string equal to the Input Question
                    varaible set with -I, -J, or -M

          You can use the following characters in the keys of a menu
          using a name in prompt ending with a # or ).

                ALT-200 (Up)    ALT-208 (Down)  ALT-205 (Right)
                ALT-203 (Left)  ALT-199 (Home)  ALT-207 (End)

          All pipe codes are also applicable in this prompt.

              This command is used to make menus that ask questions,
          create hotkeyed type menus, or get input from users.

          Bx
            Does Bar selection menu with x number of columns

          R
            Uses a one-line bar menu. When creating command stacks,
            make sure to only put a description on the first option in
            the stack, otherwise your whole command stack will appear
            on this menu. Also, make sure that all options don't exceed
            80 colums, as this is a ONE line bar menu. If your options
            exceed the 80 column limit, use the bar menus.


          <filename.ext>

              With this option in the menu editor, you can create your
          own pulldown menus! You'll need to create an ansi design for
          your menu and add in a few MCI codes to tell the BBS where to
          place information. There are two types of MCI codes that
          you'll need to use for this menu. The first, |xx, tells the
          BBS where to put the highlight bar. The second type is the
          %xx, this tells the BBS what color to use when the option is
          not highlighted. When you place these codes in your ansi, it
          becomes practical to place them next to each other like this.
          |xx%xx. You can include any other |xx color codes (1-15) to
          change colors in the unhighlighted display. Use the |- command
          to return to the original unhighlighted color.

              These xx's must be replaced by numbers so that the BBS
          knows which option to execute. Thats where the pulldown ID
          field of the menu editor comes into play. You need to give
          each one of your options a unique ID#. Start at 1 for the
          first option, and then use 2 for the second option and so on.
          If you're stacking commands for a certain part of your menu,
          only give the first command a pulldown ID.

              So, say you want to make a pulldown matrix with 5
          options. Logon, Check, Apply, Feedback, and Logoff. Create
          your MATRIX.MNU, and add in each of these 5 options. (Look at
          the above documentation for all of the menu commands to use).
          After that is done, go back and place a pulldown ID for each
          option. Since you have 5 options, and no command stacking,
          just give login a pulldown ID of 1, Check a 2, Apply a 3,
          Feedback a 4, and Logoff a 5. After you've done this, create
          your ANSI for the pulldown menu. Put in the MCI codes as
          described above, and your menu is all ready to go.

              Now, say that you wanted to make that same matrix but you
          wanted to use some type of command stacking in it. For
          example: Say that you want the BBS to login a user after
          they've checked and found out that they have access. This is
          done by using the failflag and a few menu commands. Since
          this option requires more than one menu command, it's called
          a command 'stack'. Now, the first option in this stack is
          going to be the check command. Only use the pulldown ID for
          this command, and not for any other command in the stack.
          (For this example, the other command would be the Drop into
          BBS menu command {X. Make sure not to give that a pulldown
          ID.)

              Now, you're probably wondering why you only put an ID on
          the first command in the stack. Think about it this way, you
          only want the pulldown bar to go onto the options that the
          user can execute, and not commands that you've customized to
          perform more than one function. Only the first function
          should have the ID.

              Instead of only using up and down in your pulldowns, you
          can use left and right. Below are the sybmols that you'll
          need to use in the "Keys" field for the BBS to recognize left
          and right.

          Left : Ë  (ALT-203)
          Right: Í  (ALT-205)

          If you want to use left/right, make the option(s) hidden, and
          give them a pulldown ID of 0.

          If you put "L" as the name in prompt of a pulldown menu, left
          will be interpreted as up, and right will be interpreted as down.

              Another handy option that you might consider using is the
          hidden flag. You can make a hidden option that doesn't appear
          on the pulldown menu, but that the user can execute via
          hotkey. So, give your hidden option a pulldown ID of 0, and
          turn on the hidden flag, and the command will become
          hotkeyed, and you'll be able to execute it w/o using the bar.


            There is wildcarding for menu commands:

              If you set the Key to X*, then you can put * in the
              Cstring and that will put what follows the X in the
              Cstring. This is advisable for such cases as file
              conference jumping such as J* with would do JM with a
              Cstring of * so one could J1,J2, etc.

            Also a possibility for CString is & in which is set to the
          input gotten with -I, -J, or set with -*.

               There are a few special menus in the editor. One, called
          MATRIX.MNU, is your logon matrix. You can call other menus
          with it, but your starting menu must be MATRIX.MNU. A second
          important menu is called GLOBAL.MNU. In this menu, every
          command will you add will be valid on every other menu.
          (Example, adding a goodbye command into the GLOBAL.MNU will
          allow your users to hang up at any menu.)

               A second thing you'll see mentioned in the menu editor
          is called 'Command Stacking'. Think of this as command
          linking. One command can do more than one operation. For
          example, you can have a command that clears the screen (-L),
          and prints a file to the screen (-F). To do this, you need to
          make your 'Keys' Field in the menu editor identical. Example:
          Create a command with 'Keys' as "T". Make one command with
          the 'Command Keys' as -L, and another with 'Command Keys' as
          -F. Make sure the 'Keys' field is "T" in both. Notice now,
          that the command will first clear the screen (-L), and then
          print a file (-F) (Enter a filename in the Cstring of the -F
          command). This is a simple example, but the idea is the same.
          Stacks get bigger and more complicated, but the general idea
          stays the same. (Notice examples below)

          Another example, the not very nice case.  This was devised by
          me, Darkened Enmity for Whiplash.  He wanted to use a
          pulldown menu to select file conferences. I got the idea of
          the -* command and the use of & in the CString.  I knew that
          would work, and the next day I wrote out the codes. This is
          the CONFHAND.MNU for you to look at since it is complex,
          but will allow you to understand how things are done. There
          is a menu called CONFSEL.MNU that will select the file
          conference in a pulldown.  CONFHAND is called like this:

          Command 1 in Stack:
          Command Keys  : -*
          Keys          : T*
          Command String: *

          Command 2 in Stack:
          Command Keys  : -/
          Keys          : T*
          Command String: CONFHAND

          Now here is CONFHAND.MNU:

                                netmail through Fidonet mail. For this
                                option to work, you must compile a copy
                                of your nodelist and place it in your
                                Echomail directory. Compile the
                                nodelist as filename nodelist.dat, and
                                using BINKLEY6 format. The reason you
                                must compile the nodelist in the
                                echomail directory is for the nodelist
                                lookup function of the BBS. The BBS
                                will allow users to search the nodelist
                                for the node that they wish to send
                                netmail to.
          Node                - Assigned to you by your network
                                moderator. Basically shows location.
                                Form varies, but usually its X:XXX/XXX.
          QWKName             - Shortened name of the message base to
                                be displayed to users in their offline
                                readers. Most offline readers cannot
                                support message base names over 10-12
                                spaces. Use this option so that users
                                can better recognize which base they
                                are in from their reader.
          Autodelete          - How many total messages do you want in
                                the message base. When the # of
                                messages in the base is equal to the
                                number in this field, 5 messages will
                                be erased. This keeps your message base
                                files from growing increasingly large.
          Real names          - Should the user's real name be used in
                                place of a handle in this message base?
          Base filename       - This is an up to 8 character filename
                                that the BBS will use to store your
                                messages in.
          Mandatory           - When this flag is set to Yes, all the
                                messages in this base will be forced.
                                Users must read these messages. Use
                                message bases like this for news.
          Allow private       - Should users be able to post private
                                messages in this base. Use this flag if
                                the network you're in supports private
                                echomailing.

               Using the base filename, you can create a 'shared'
          message base. What this means is that you can have the same
          message base in more than one conference, or if you run
          multiple Systems, can have it on two different boards. (ie:
          System one, and System two can have identical message bases
          if the sysop should wish). To create a shared message base,
          use the same base filename in two message areas. They will
          then be shared. Once you post a message in one area, it will
          appear in both, and vice versa. When you wish to remove a
          shared message base, you have an option. You can either
          delete the data file, or leave it. By deleting the data file
          in a shared area, both message bases that were sharing that
          data file will lose all of their messages. By leaving the
          data file there, you can remove the base from one place, but
          keep it in another.

               To create a message base for system news, it takes a few
          simple steps. First, create a message base, and name it
          System news, or whatever you want. Fill out the rest of the
          questions. When you come to 'Mandatory', turn it to Yes. When
          a user logs on, the BBS will check this message base for new
          posts, and then proceed to show them to the user. (Look at
          the example screen for the message base editor. This is an
          ideal setup for news.)

               Another thing to be clear about: If you ever have a base
          that you are using for echomail, and want to turn off
          echomail, do this: Edit the Import/Export directory setting,
          and then press 'CTRL-Y'. The field will be cleared. Press
          enter. Now, this base is no longer an echomail base, but now
          a normal message base.

               When going to edit a file base, you will be presented
          with a similar looking editor. It looks a little like this:

          Password            - Password required to enter file area.
          Area filename       - Filename (w/o extension) that the BBS
                                will use to store file information for
                                the current area.

               You may also create 'shared' file areas. Read the above
          paragraphs for explanations on how to do this.


                          SECTION 15: THE UPLOAD CHECKER
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The upload checker will check all uploaded files for CRC
          errors, viruses, age, and can optionally add/delete files, or
          add a comment to your uploaded files. Operation of the
          checker is quite simple. It only requires the creation of one
          screen.  This screen, called ULCHECK.ANS, will be the display
          to the user when files are being checked. Making this screen
          is really easy, there are a few MCI codes to use in the
          screen.  They are as follows:

          |FN  - Filename
          |B1  - þ in CRC Checking.
          |M1  - Strings displayed during CRC checking.
          |B2  - þ in virus scanning.
          |M2  - Strings displayed in virus scanning.
          |B3  - þ in age tests.
          |M3  - Strings displayed during age testing.
          |B4  - þ in deleting files from archive.
          |M4  - Strings displayed during deleting.
          |B5  - þ in adding files.
          |M5  - Strings displayed in adding files.
          |B6  - þ in comment adding.
          |M6  - Strings displayed when adding comments.
          |B7  - þ in file maintainence. (MAINTAIN.BAT)
          |M7  - Strings displayed when running MAINTAIN.BAT.

               These codes are pretty easy to figure out. Each option
          has a blinking þ that is displayed when that operation is in
          process. When the option completes, the þ will stop blinking.
          The |Bx MCI goes where you want the þ to go for each option.
          The |Mx MCI codes go where you want any progress/error
          messages displayed about the current operation. All of these
          messages can be configured via the string editor.

               All of the setup for the upload checker is done in the
          CONFIG program, specifically under 'System Options #2'. You
          can completely toggle off the checker, or certain operations
          of it by leaving the field blank. For example, if you don't
          want to add any files to your checked files, then leave
          'Files to add' in the CONFIG blank. The same goes for
          commenting, or scanning.

               A nice feature of the upload checker is that it can
          perform age constraint testing on your uploaded files. In
          System Options #2, there is a date field. Set this to
          whatever you want, and if the newest file is older than the
          date specified, the file will fail the upload checking.

               The unique part of the upload checker is that you can
          perform additional maintainence via a batch file called
          MAINTAIN.BAT. (Note: FILE_ID.DIZ checking is now internal to
          the upload checker, so you don't have to create a special
          maintain.bat that will extract FILE_ID.DIZ). There are two %
          codes that can be used in the maintain.bat. These are %1 for
          filename, and %2 for path of the work directory. Note that %2
          will also include the trailing backslash of the work
          directory's path.


                        SECTION 16: CONFIGURABLE ARCHIVERS
                        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The configurable archiver system allows the SysOp to
          setup multiple archivers, and allow the BBS to use these
          archivers for various operations. You can configure as many
          archivers as you want, and the users will be able to choose
          which archiver they want to use. The BBS will then use their
          default choice to pack QWK packets, pack message captures,
          pack filelists etc, View Files, Extract Files etc..

               Another good thing about the archiver system is that it
          can automatically detect what type of archive it's working
          with. It doesn't use the extension, but it uses the signature
          to find out what type of archive is present. A signature is a
          certain identification string that lets you identify what
          type of archive is being used. More on this will be explained
          later.

               Editing, and adding archivers is quite simple. The menu
          command for configurable archivers is *Z. Once you're in the
          archiver editor, the screen will look a bit like this:

          The above commands will be explained here:


          Archive name        - Enter the name of the archiver.
          Archive extension   - Enter the extension that this archiver
                                produces.
          Use ZIP viewer      - This toggles the use of the Obv/2
                                internal ZIP viewer. Only turn this on
                                if the archiver is ZIP compatible.
          Swap for commands   - If you want the BBS to swap to DISK/EMS
                                XMS before running archiver commands,
                                turn this option on.
          Compression command - Place the command that the archive uses
                                to compress files. %1 = Path and
                                filename, and %2 = wildcard. (All of
                                this will be filled in by the BBS.)
          Extraction command  - Place the command that the archive uses
                                to extract files. %1 = Path and
                                filename, %2 = wildcard, and %3 = Path
                                to your work directory.
          View command        - Place the command that the archive uses
                                to view files. You must force output to
                                a file using DOS redirection commands,
                                BUT you must do this using a batch file
                                .  The file that contains the output
                                from the archiver must be named
                                ARCLIST.  and it must be in your work
                                directory.  %1 = Path and filename, %2
                                = wildcard, and %3 = path to your work
                                directory. Here is an example batch
                                file:
                                @%2..\PKUNZIP.EXE -V %1>%2ARCLIST.
                                See the example above if you don't
                                understand how to redirect the output
                                of the archiver.
          Make SFX command    - This is the command that the archive
                                uses to create Self-Extracting (.EXE)
                                archives. %1 = Path and filename, %2 =
                                wildcard, and %3 = path to your work
                                directory.
          Maximum Errorlevel  - Errorlevels above this # will be
                                interpreted as a failed upload. #'s
                                under this will be passed uploads.
                                Due to PKZIP's -AV, you should make
                                this option 1 for ZIP. Other archivers
                                vary. See the archivers documentation
                                on the errorlevels it passes on failed
                                and passed archives.
          Add comment command - This is the command that the archive
                                uses to add comments to the archive.
                                Again, you must follow the above
                                example of redirection with a batch
                                file.  %1 = Path and filename, and %2 =
                                Comment file.  You can setup this file
                                in the CONFIG under System Options #2.
          Add files command   - This is the command that the archive
                                uses to add additional files to an
                                archive. %1 = Path and filename, and %2
                                = the files to add to the archive. This
                                also can be configured via System
                                Options #2 in the CONFIG.
          Signature String    - This is the signature identification of
                                the archiver. Each archiver has a
                                certain ID string that it uses to
                                identify archives that it made. For
                                example, PKZIP puts a PK in the first
                                two bytes of its files. This lets PKZIP
                                know that any file with a PK in the
                                first two bytes was created by PKZIP.
                                If this ID changes, like in LHA, you
                                can use a ? in the signature location
                                to signify a wildcard. You MUST have
                                other letters that the program can
                                search for. DO NOT JUST PUT ? in the
                                sig string! You must enter all of the
                                signature ID's in HEX format. So, go
                                into a hex editor, and find the
                                signature and its location, then enter
                                the string in HEX.
          Signature location   - This is the location in bytes of the
                                 starting location of the signature
                                 string.  So, if the first two letters
                                 of the archive are PK, then you'd put
                                 1 in this field.
          List prefix          - Many archivers use a certain charater
                                 when you want the program to read in a
                                 list of files from a textfile. IE: In
                                 PKZIP, you can ZIP a group of files
                                 that you specify in a textfile like
                                 this: PKZIP OBV2-210.ZIP
                                 @C:\OBV2\OBV2.LST  It will ZIP up all
                                 of the files in OBV2.LST. Well, as you
                                 can see, you had to preceed that file
                                 by a @. This @ is the list character.
                                 Enter the list character in this
                                 field.
          Checker Only         - This option should always be set
                                 to No for an archiver such as
                                 PKZIP, ARJ, LZH etc. If you want
                                 to add a program which is not an
                                 archiver to manipulate the files,
                                 then set this option to yes. An
                                 example of this would be a program
                                 that took the GIFspec of a file, and
                                 placed that information into a FILE_ID.DIZ
                                 which the BBS could import. Included with
                                 Oblivion/2 is support for SAUCE commenting
                                 standard. The program called SAUCEPAN.EXE
                                 will read the ansi, and create a FILE_ID.DIZ
                                 according to a sysop-specified template.
                                 This FILE_ID.DIZ will be imported after
                                 the program runs. The above 2 examples
                                 (GIFSpec, and SAUCE) are two times when
                                 the 'Checker Only' option should be set
                                 to yes. See the docs to SAUCEPAN for info
                                 on how to setup SAUCE with Oblivion/2.

                      SECTION 17: GENERIC MENU CONFIGURATION
                      ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               Ever needed to complete that killer configuration, but
          you were missing one part. Which part could that be? You have
          your status screens, menu (MNU) files, prompts, strings. What
          else is there? The ANSI menus.

               ANSI menus can be used to give that final touch. What if
          you can't make them as good as other people? What if you
          don't want the ones available. What if you want a simple
          straightforward, no-nonsense menu set. What can you do?

               The answer is generic menus. Don't let the name fool
          you, these are more powerful than ANSI menus. You don't need
          to constantly edit these menus whenever you modify your menu
          commands. These will update themselves automatically.

               How do you make these generic menus? It's done simply by
          making a REPEAT ansi. This 3-part repeat ANSI will let the
          BBS automatically update the menus when a new command is
          added. (Read the section on making repeat ANSI files before
          you continue further.)

               Now that you're fimilar with the 3-part repeat ANSI
          method, lets make some generic menus. First, you'll need to
          know the MCI codes for theses screens. They are as follows:

          GENSRT.ANS  -- Generic Menu Template Start ANSI
            MCI Code: |MT  -- Menu Title
          GENMID.ANS  -- Generic Menu Template Middle ANSI
            MCI Code: |K?  -- Keys for option ? in the line
            MCI Code: |D?  -- Description for option ? in the line
          GENEND.ANS  -- Generic Menu Template End ANSI

               Now, if you'd read the section on making repeat ANSIs,
          this should be really easy for you. If not, go back and read
          them! The first ansi GENSRT.ANS is pretty straightforward. So
          is the last one, GENEND.ANS. The middle ANSI, GENMID.ANS
          needs a little explaining.

               Before you can edit the GENMID.ANS file, you should
          decide how many options you want per column in your generic
          menus. This is a CONFIG option under System Configuration #2.
          The limits are 1-9. After you've entered this #, you're ready
          to make a set of generic menus.

               The two pipe codes |Kx, and |Dx that make up the
          GENMID.ANS file are very simple. One prints the KEY, and the
          other prints the DESCRIPTION. Say you wanted to make a
          generic menu set that had 3 columns, and 5 options per row.

               First, you'll need to go into the CONFIG, and set that #
          of lines option to 5. (This option was discussed about 2
          paragraphs above.) Next, edit the GENMID.ANS file. Place your
          MCI codes in a simple fashion like this:

          [|K1] |D1             [|K2] |D2               [|K3] |D3

          With an arrangement like this, your generic menu will look
          something like this.

          [1] Option #1         [2] Option #2           [3] Option #3
          [4] Option #4         [5] Option #5           [6] Option #6
          (And so on for 5 total lines. This menu would fit a maximum
           of 15 total options. 3 columns x 5 rows)

               As you can see making these menus is quite simple. Now,
          after you've made your menus, you have a few choices of where
          to put them. You can code the menu into a status screen
          library, or you can code it into a menu library.

               If you wish to code it into a status screen library,
          include the GENxxx.ANS files in your temp directory, and
          STATCODE.EXE will automatically include them in the completed
          LIB/NDX files.

               If you want to code the generic menus into a menu
          library of their own, you'll need to add a commandline option
          to menu code. This option, /G, will code generic menus into a
          menu library file. An example commandline would be:

          MENUCODE.EXE OBV2 C:\TEMP\ /G

          This codes the OBV2.LIB file from the files found in
          C:\TEMP\. It will also code the GENxxx.ANS files in the temp
          directory.

               You also get another added feature when you code the
          generic menus through a menu library. You can override that
          config option we spoke of. (# of options per row). In our
          example, we had 5 options per row. Say that you wanted to
          change that to 3 options per row for this PARTICULAR set
          only. You'd do the following.

          MENUCODE.EXE 3OBV2 C:\TEMP\ /G

               The 3 before the rest of the library name told Obv/2
          that this generic menu set will be using 3 options per row.
          You can make that number anything between 1-9. This allows
          you to make differently styled menus and let the users
          select. Note that now your compiled library is called
          3OBV2.LIB and not simply OBV2.LIB.

                          SECTION 18: Functions of ANSI.SYS
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

          The ANSI escape codes for screen control supported by the MS-DOS
          ANSI.SYS device are a subset of the ANSI 3.64-1979 standard.
          They are used by Oblivion/2 to manipulate screen information,
          primarily cursor position and color changes.

          An escape code consists of two segments of data: (1) an identifier
          (the esc[ part, esc being the ASCII char AltGr-27 or 1Bh) and (2)
          the control code, the actual command to perform on the cursor or
          screen. Thus, all ANSI codes begin with esc[ and end with a code.
          All codes supported by ANSI.SYS are listed below, the identifier
          included, with a short description of it's use.

          Note that case is significant for the last character in an
          escape sequence and that numbers must always be represented as
          ASCII digit strings, not as their binary values. Also note,
          that cursor positions are one-based, making 1,1 upper left corner
          (and not 0,0). (A separate set of escape sequences supported by
          ANSI.SYS, but not compatible with the ANSI standard, may be used
          for reprogramming and remapping the keyboard. These are not
          supported by Oblivion/2).

          ================================================================
          Escape
          Sequence:       Meaning:
          ================================================================
          Esc[2J          Clear screen. Place cursor in upper left corner
                          (home position).
          Esc[K           Clear from cursor to EOL.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          Esc[row;colH    Position cursor. (Row is the y coordinate in the
                          range of 1-25 and col is the x coordinate in the
                          range of 1-80 for 80-by-25 text display modes).
                          Escape sequences terminated with the letter f
                          instead of H have the same effect. (Esc[H will
                          home cursor).
          *NOTE*          Since ANSI.SYS doesn't support go to X column in
                          current row, and thus TheDraw doesn't add that
                          code in, Obv/2 uses it's own. Esc[;xxH should go
                          to XXth column in first row, but for middle in
                          the repeat ansis (and only middle in the repeat
                          ansis), it goes to the XXth column in the current
                          row. You therefore need to edit your repeat ansi
                          in an ascii editor when you've finished the
                          middle part. See the section about repeat ansis
                          for more information.
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          Esc[nA          Move cursor up n rows.
          Esc[nB          Move cursor down n rows.
          Esc[nC          Move cursor right n rows.
          Esc[nD          Move cursor left n rows.
          Esc[s           Save current cursor position.
          Esc[u           Restore cursor to saved position.
          Esc[6n          Return current cursor position on the standard
                          input handle in the format esc[row;colR.
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          Esc[nm          Select character attributes (values for n):
                          0=no special attibutes
                          1=high intensity

           ABOUT OS/2
           ----------

           OS/2 is probably the best operating system available,
           whether for running DOS, Windows or OS/2 applications.
           It gives you superb multitasking, while still being
           easy to use and setup. However, the default configura-
           tion provided by IBM may not be the best for your
           system, and you can probably gain in performance by
           changing a few things.  This chapter is divided into
           four parts, each covering their own topic:
              The first is an introduction to OS/2 for those still
           using DV (either loving or hating it) - when and why
           they should consider upgrading to OS/2.
              The second is a collection of tips and tricks I have
           learned through using OS/2 for a long time, as well as
           a guide to optimizing your system for performance.
              The third is a list of utilities for OS/2 - what
           they offer you, and how you use/install them.
              The fourth and last part is specifically dedicated
           to running a bbs and a mailer under OS/2 - a few
           last words on the experiences I have made while
           running a BBS under OS/2.


           1: About OS/2
           -------------
           First, let's make sure you aren't wasting your time.
           In order to use OS/2 (as opposed to just looking at
           it or waiting for it), you need a 386dx40 with 8mb
           ram. Dont install OS/2 if you have less ram - it's
           well worth the money for some extra ram, and you're
           going to need 8mb ram anyways in case you consider
           running Chicago when that arrives late 1995 <g>.
              In general, ram is more important to OS/2 than
           cpu - I'd choose a 486sx20 with 16mb over a 486dx2
           with 8mb any time.

           Why should you install OS/2 in the first place?
              First, there's the multitasking.  Since you're a
           sysop, wouldnt you like to browse the networks while
           a user was online - or zip those private files for
           the online user, without shelling to dos.  Ofcourse,
           formatting those 50 disks and 10 tapes you just bought
           is much less time consuming in the background.
           Processing a lot of mail? - you just run GEcho in
           the background when you get a mail call. A future
           version of Oblivion/2 may support background upload
           checking, so your users can continue being online while
           Obv/2 processes their uploads!  You get the point :)

           But you can do all that under DesqView, no need for
           you to switch from your current system. Or?
              You'll gain memory management like you've never
           dreamed possible. No matter how many device drivers
           you load, they will eat 0 bytes low DOS memory, so you
           always end up with around 640kb largest executable
           program size. I'd say that's fairly nice. It's one of
           the advantages of the DOS running under OS/2 being
           100% emulated.
              As opposed to DV, if you run a nasty application
           and it crashes/hangs, you simply close it and start
           a new task - it wont crash the whole system. That's
           very valuable when testing task settings or testing
           a fragile product.
              Another valuable addition is virus, ansi bomb
           and trojan protection through omitting certain
           functions from the DOS emulation. Direct sector-
           writes are not allowed, and if you try to format
           a drive you are asked for additional confirmations,
           not just (y/N). That gives protection from almost
           anything, except ViSiON-X <G>.

           You hate that graphical user interface (GUI) - it has to
           be much slower and complicated to use than good old DOS?
              Look out your window at that car passing by. Was that
           a yellow sports-car or was it a SUPRA G9/XLi?  Pictures
           are much easier to remember, and you can customize your
           OS/2 desktop in every aspect. Colors, folders (they're
           like directories under DOS), icons, and much more (far
           too detailed to put here).  Do you use Norton Commander?
           That's one way of simplifying commands and putting up an
           easier interface for accessing your files. OS/2's GUI is
           but a step further up the interface.
              Dont be mistaken though, you're not replacing your
           prompt and putting a shell around your computer.  OS/2
           doesnt turn your PC into a MAC - you simply press enter
           or double-click an icon, and you're back where you feel
           home.  You arent loosing anything, thus you can only be
           gaining - right? :)


           2: Optimizing OS/2
           ------------------
           This section assumes you know OS/2 and how to get from the
           desktop into the different settings and configuration menus.
           If you dont, read whatever comes with OS/2 (I havent seen
           the 2.1 manuals :), and it will most likely tell you how
           you do this.

              As you will have noticed, in the menu where you specify
           whether a task is to be DOS or OS/2, Full-screen or window,
           there is no OS/2_Settings button next to the DOS_Settings.
           That is because OS/2 tasks figure this out on their own -
           they are written to work with OS/2 and dont need to be
           customized like DOS programs. Thus, this section will only
           explain settings related to DOS programs.

           Lets take a look at your CONFIG.SYS - here's a few tips
           on setting it up correctly:

              IFS=F:\OS2\HPFS.IFS /CACHE:1024 /CRECL:64 /AUTOCHECK:DEF
           This line determines the cache size for HPFS, OS/2's file-
           system. Unless you're using OS/2 only, and never booting
           DOS, I suggest you have at least 10mb ram before
           considering HPFS. It is faster on big drives, but will eat
           too much ram if you have only 6 or 8mb. If you have no
           HPFS drives at all, make sure this line isnt present or
           contains a REM to disable it.
              BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:0 /U:0 /SMS /V
           This one is your IDE/AT-BUS device driver. The above will
           boost performance on drive 1 in your system, in case it
           supports SMS.  Look up BASEDEV for more information on this.
              SET AUTOSTART=TASKLIST,FOLDERS,CONNECTIONS
           Remove PROGRAMS from this line, or you may end up with a
           loop crashing your system.
              SET COMSPEC=F:\OS2\CMD.EXE
           Normally you dont have an autoexec.cmd file when starting
           OS/2 programs. Adding "/K AUTO.CMD" will run AUTO.CMD
           every time you start an OS/2 task.
              SET DELDIR=
              REM SET DELDIR=C:\DELETE,512;E:\DELETE,2048;
           OS/2 handles deleted files by copying them into a
           directory specified here. Turning off the delete directory
           as done in line 1, severely speeds up delete time as OS/2
           doesnt copy/move your file(s) to the delete directory.
           Instead of using DELDIR you should install GammaTools,
           please see section 3 (utilities) for more on this.
               SET DPATH=F:\OS2;F:\OS2\SYSTEM;...
           This is NOT your DOS path, as one is led to believe
           through the name. DPATH is your data path, and you seldom
           need to edit this yourself. LIBPATH is you library path,
           and it is wise to add a directory to that where you store
           DLL's from installed programs, so as not to mix them up
           with OS/2's own DLL files. Finally, PATH is your OS/2 path
           and here goes the path to your OS/2 batch directory (*.CMD
           files), utility directories, etc.  Use the autoexec files
           to set your DOS path.
              SET OS2_SHELL=F:\OS2\CMD.EXE
           That "/K AUTO.CMD" might be for this line, I'm not using
           it myself :-)  Experiment, and tell me ;)
              SET PROMPT=[$p]
           To get rid of that help line OS/2 has, remove "$i" from
           your prompt line.
              PRIORITY_DISK_IO=NO
           Give the foreground task priority in disk I/O?  Since
           you're running a BBS setting it to NO will give better
           disk access for upload checking or searching, while you
           may feel a slowdown in your current task. The slower
           your computer is, the more you'd probably want to put
           it to YES.
              THREADS=128
           A program can branch off a thread - it's the way to do
           multiple things at once within the same program. Unless
           you're doing a lot of work, you can reduce the default
           to 128 and save some RAM. Read section 3 (PM Patrol) to
           find out how you can monitor active number of threads.
              AUTOFAIL=YES
           Removes those ugly big-screen error messages when you
           fx access a floppy drive w/o a disk inserted. Instead,
           OS/2 simply fails and reports "Drive A: not ready".
              DISKCACHE=512,LW,64,AUTOCCHECK:C
           This is for FAT formatted drives only. LW enables Lazy-
           Write; 64 is similar to the CRECL value in the HPFS
           statement, and determines how large chunks of files
           should be cached. The AUTOCHECK statement specifies
           which drives to check after a system crash (those
           forced by a reset or power loss). In general, make
           sure all drives are listed in your AUTOCHECK statements.
           Refer to your OS/2 manual for FAT cache sizes - remove
           it if you have no FAT drives at all - and _DONT_ install
           an external cache.
              SWAPPATH=F:\ 2048 8192
           This is where your swapfile resides, how much space
           should be left on the drive where it resides before OS/2
           alerts you of low disk space, and how large it should be
           initially. Specifying the root of a drive speeds up
           performance a weeny bit, but that's for the fanatics
           like me :)  Specifying too small a value for the swap
           file size will make OS/2 continually work on keeping the
           swap file within the limits you specify, causing overall
           performance to drop. A good rule of thumb is to set the
           size = ( 20 - xx mb ram installed).  I have 16mb, and have
           an 8mb swap file - 4 would probably suffice, but I dont
           mind the space for the gain in performance.
              RMSIZE=640
           If you want to use the MODE_RESTRICTION=CGA setting found
           in the DOS_Settings, you should set this to 639 (kb)
           instead, as a bug in OS/2 2.10 turns off that options
           when 640 is specified. Not all programs like CGA to be
           off, but it will give you another 96kb low DOS memory,
           and could be useful in some cases. It is similar to the
           QEMM STEALTH option, if I recall correctly.
              DEVICE=C:\OUTIL\FOSSIL\SIO.SYS (COM1:38400,3F8,IRQ4,,F)
           Replace COM with SIO (Serial I/O drivers), they are much
           better and they also provide a fossil for use in DOS boxes
           under OS/2. They are written by the author of X00 - read more
           in section 3 about SIO.
              DEVICE=F:\OS2\VDISK.SYS 512,,
           A ram disk such as this is useful for swap files and
           temporary packets such as created by InterMail. Use only
           if you have enough ram!
              DOS=HIGH,UMB
           Make sure you change that default LOW,NOUMB into
           HIGH,UMB to get more DOS memory. I wonder what IBM was
           thinking when they made LOW,NOUMB default!
              DEVICE=C:\OUTIL\FOSSIL\VSIO.SYS
           SIO again - this is the VCOM replacement.
              DEVICEHIGH=F:\OS2\MDOS\ANSI.SYS
           All those nice DOS devices - just put a DEVICEHIGH
           instead of DEVICE and you might gain an extra kb or two
           in DOS memory. I am using this, and it certainly won't make
           your system crash, but I can't vouch for the memory gain.

           Further, you can speed up your boot time by sorting the
           commands in your config.sys.  Beware of doing this, as
           OS/2 will refuse to boot if you make a mistake, and the
           order in which to sort may not seem 100% clear (it's NOT
           A-Z!).  But there is a lot to gain (I went from 45 to 30
           seconds boot time!) by doing it. Grab the file called
           CFGSRT11.ZIP off your local PD OS/2 board, or do it as
           in my config.sys, which should be included in the Obv/2
           package. But be careful and have a backup ready.

           Next, lets take a quick look at the "DOS Settings",
           which is your way of customizing every single DOS task
           to it's specific needs and 'bugs'. I shall do this like
           the config, and only comment those worth commenting:

              DOS_AUTOEXEC       [F:\AUTO_BBS.BAT]
           Specify a different one for every task is a good way of
           customizing your DOS task, regarding environments,
           doskey, command processor (4DOS), etc...
              DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION        [ON]
           Leave on for the BBS, but off for TheDraw or SimCity,
           as they shouldnt use any cpu when you're not in that task.
              DOS_DEVICE      [C:\FOSSIL\VX00.SYS]
           This is the fossil driver for DOS, found in the SIO
           package. Be sure to load it in every task using com
           ports, and don't use X00 as VX00 was written specifically
           for DOS under OS/2.  A good tip is to write "SIZE=0 "
           before the actual device driver - and it will use no
           DOS memory.
              DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE               []
           Having problems making a program work?  Use VMDISK to
           create a DOS image file, from which you can boot (fx
           [DOS.IMG] would boot from a file called DOS.IMG).  It
           makes your task just like a real DOS, you can also
           specify fx [C:] in the brackets, causing you to boot
           from your C: drive (while running OS/2 ofcourse :)
              DOS_VERSION  [C:\DOS\FORMAT.COM,6,20,255]
           The format command of OS/2 doesnt support the /Q switch
           - using DOS_VERSION you can make all the nasty MSDOS
           utils work too.
              HW_TIMER                    [OFF]
           Hardware timer - unless you want that yeller Obv/2 has
           to go bananas you should turn this on, although it may
           decrease performance a bit. I'm not sure :-)
              IDLE_SECONDS                 [0]
           Specifies the amount of time a program has to be idle
           before OS/2 will quench it's cpu usage - this is useful
           in making keyboard polling programs use less or no cpu.
           In most cases a setting of 0 will be best, although I
           recommend 2-3 for your BBS task - you wouldnt want OS/2
           to take back cpu at a critical moment when your modem
           re-negotiates.
              IDLE_SENSITIVITY             [50]
           This is _THE_ setting of them all to optimize your
           system. Set it to at least 40 for your bbs task, or
           higher if your computer isnt at least a 486dx ;)
           Reduce to 1 on programs doing nothing mission
           critical but stealing all of your cpu - this goes for
           programs like Borland Pascal, TheDraw, Norton Commander
           or Boomer's Utils.  Set it to 100 on sensitive programs
           such as CP Backup (which tolerates almost nothing). Use
           PM Patrol (see section 3) to determine the correct
           setting for a specific program.
              VIDEO_XXX
           All the VIDEO setting need only be changed when you run
           a game or similar thing - the defaults are okay for
           your plain DOS tasks.

           And finally, all kinds of extra tricks about OS/2 -
           either performance or usage related, in no special
           order:
           - Turn animation and progress indication off - they're
             just slowing down your system.  Dont install a
             picture as a background, it will eat about 1mb
             valuable memory and use a lot of extra cpu in usage.
           - Putting programs in the startup folder causes them
             to start at boot. You can control the sequence by
             making the startup folder "flowed" and adding the
             icons in a FIFO way (first in, first out).
           - Remove unused DOS device drivers from your
             CONFIG.SYS.  Those will usually be the CD-ROM driver
             or the HPFS cache.
           - To save space on your boot drive, you can delete all
             MCA drivers. They can be recognized by two files having
             the same name except for a digit which will be either
             1 or 2.  For example, IBMxFLPY.ADD.  The 2 files are
             only for MCA machines.
           - Changing resolution can be a pain if OS/2 does not
             detect your hardware correctly.  After a boot your
             screen will be out of sync, and you can see nothing.
             (A) Boot OS/2 from floppy, go to your boot drives \OS2
                 directory and run "SETVGA X:" (X being your drive
                 letter). This restores your mode to the default.
             (B) Delete the file called SVGADATA.PMI in your \OS2
                 directory and reboot. This may only work for standard
                 cards such as TSENG, but it worked for me, and you
                 can always use (A) to restore whatever you've
                 messed up.
           - Put "[]" in the parameter field of a task and it will
             ask you for parameters on execution.  Good for a virus-
             scanner or defragger. Any text you put between the
             brackets will be displayed to you when OS/2 prompts
             for the parameter.
           - When you change settings for your tasks OS/2 often
             'forgets' your icon.  Just click the UNDO button in the
             'General' settings, and it'll be back.
           - Deleting undeletable objects: Move the file onto a
             floppy drive by dragging it there, then format the
             floppy.
           - Using && and || on your command-line.  Fx. "COPY *A*
             C:\ && DEL *A*" will only execute the DEL command if
             COPY was succesful. Using || would make DEL execute
             only if COPY failed. Powerful, but simple.


           3: Utilities
           ------------
           (SIOxxx.ZIP)
           First, let's get SIO installed. The worst part about SIO
           are the settings you need to setup in DOS_Settings - they
           have no description and thus you have no clue what you're
           working on. SIO is wonderful, but it can also make your
           system crash every now and then if configured incorrectly.
           The following is a list of the settings I use - they are
           certified to work with HS/Link which was a problem in the
           default configuration. Here goes:
              SIO_Idle_Sensitivity               [100]
           DONT change this - it made my system hang ever so often.
           Last time I tested was version 1.24 though.
               _Mode_DTR                 [No change..]
               _Mode_FIFO_Load_Count              [16]
               _Mode_IDSR                   [Ignore..]
               _Mode_OCTS   [..RTS/CTS or Ignore/None]
               _Mode_ODSR   [..DTR/DSR or Ignore/None]
               _Mode_RTS                 [No change..]
               _Mode_XON/XOFF          [No XON/XOFF..]
               _Sync_Kludge                      [Off]
               _Share_Access_With_OS/2           [Off]
               _Virtual*                          [On]
           Also, make sure you have an 16550A UART on your serial
           port, if you use 9600 or higher.

           (GAMMAxx.ZIP)
           Next, GammaTools. They feature a lot of good utilities
           for OS/2, such as Defrag, SectorEd, Undelete, etc..
           Fairly poor coding but they do what they were made to
           do, which is the important part.

           (EXDESK.ZIP)
           Get EXDESK - it adds a grid option to your desktop so
           you can align your icons a bit nicer. It also removes
           "arrange" from your dekstop-menu, which really makes
           this program a must.

           (PMPxxx.ZIP)
           PM Patrol is a status bar for your desktop, showing all
           you need to know about your system in a compact way -
           cpu/memory usage, drive info, swapfile size, processes,
           threads and windows open, and much more..

           (MNICON.ZIP)
           A utility adding drag'n'drop capability to your icon
           files, making it easy to assign new icons to your programs.

           (WPSBKxxx.ZIP)
           Creates a backup of your desktop, so you restore it the
           day you change to another version oredition of OS/2, or
           out of some other reason have messed your setup.

           (AMOSxxx.ZIP)
           AMOS is a program to access your HPFS drives from native
           DOS - this is extremely helpful if you need to edit your
           config.sys and you dont want to boot from the install
           disks.  Further AMOS can rescue your data the day OS/2
           wont boot and your data reside on HPFS volumes.

           (HSTARTxx.ZIP)
           A replacement to the OS/2 start command, so you can start
           a new task from another DOS task. This is how I do my mail
           tossing in the background:
           HSTART /DOS /FS /B /C C:\BATCH\GTOSS.BAT
           Look in the HSTART docs for details.


           4: Running a BBS under OS/2
           ---------------------------
           Generally you can put all DOS programs into three
           categories:
           1 - Those supporting OS/2 by slicing in an OS/2
               friendly way. These will use no cpu when idle and
               only as much as they need when being used. HS/Link
               is a fabulous example, as it will eat no more than
               5% of your cpu when a user is transferring files!
           2 - Those whose slicing can be detected by OS/2, and
               quenched according to the values specified in the
               IDLE SECONDS and IDLE SENSITIVITY settings. Most
               programs with standard program loops can be
               detected. They will use more cpu than they need
               when in use, but almost nothing when idle. A good
               example is TheDraw, which is 'tamed' completely
               through the IDLE settings.
           3 - Those who either require all available cpu or using
               non-standard loops for polling the keyboard. An
               example is GSZ, which uses 100% cpu for the same
               transfer HS/Link can do using only 5% of the total cpu.

            A lot can be gained by testing this, and replacing the
            poorly behaving programs with alternatives supporting
            OS/2. Up to version 2.10 of Oblivion/2 it was in the 3rd
            category, using all available cpu for polling the
            keyboard. As of version 2.20 this has changed, and
            Oblivion/2 is now a much more OS/2 friendly program - it
            will be much easier running multiple nodes under OS/2
            with the new version, and you can run at least 3-4 nodes
            on a single machine without any problems.  A later
            version of Oblivion/2 will include additional support,
            such as turning off local screen display, background
            upload processing and maybe even background transfers :-).

            Using a mailer under OS/2 is equal to running a bbs -
            a well behaved program will eat much less of your
            valuable resources. InterMail and FrontDoor are very
            much alike, yet IM is a much better behaved application.
            In comparison, IM will use between 0% and 20% cpu in idle
            mode, while FD will clog your system and use whatever
            it can get. Althogh newer versions of FD may have
            improved, I would still recommed IM over FD.

            In short, use the cpu monitoring program PM Patrol
            whenever possible to determine if a program is well
            behaved or you should go look for an alternative.

                            SECTION 20: USING E-MAIL TAGS
                            ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

               The E-Mail tag system is a powerful system that gives
          you extended control of your electronic mail. The tag system
          allows you to assign certain tags with certain types of email.
          For example, you could assign new user application mail a
          tag of 1. Then, you could give a user (other than the sysop)
          access to read mail with tag 1 (CoSysOp for example). Then,
          the CoSysOp would be able to validate new users. This system
          can be used for many other things. It's all up to your imagination.

               The system has 4 basic menu commands. They are as follows:

          E+ - Allows user to read all mail with specified tag.
               (Use the E$ and E# commands to set the Tag#)
          E- - Lets user see only mail addressed to him.
               (Puts things back to normal)
          E$ - Sets the incoming E-Mail tag to the value of CString.
               CString: 0-255  --  If CString = 0, user can see ALL
               mail regardless of tag.
          E# - Sets the outgoing E-Mail tag to the value of CString.
               CString: 0-255  -- If CString = 0, user can see ALL
               mail regardless of tag.

               This is how one would go about setting up the above example
          of allowing a cosysop to read the new user feedback.

          Step 1: Stack a E$ command with a CString of 1 before the
                  apply command at the matrix.
          Step 2: Stack a E$ command with a CString of 0 AFTER the
                  apply command at the matrix.
          Step 3: Add 2 commands to the E-Mail menu. The first being
                  E$ with a CString of 1. The second one should be
                  an E+ command. (These should be stacked together
                  Give them a certain key, so that your cosysop
                  will hit this key to read the new user mail.)
          Step 4: Add 2 commands to the E-Mail menu. The first
                  being E$ with a CString of 0. The second should
                  be an E-. (Stack these together, but make sure that
                  the key that you use is different than the key
                  that you used in Step 3. When the cosysop presses
                  this key, it will make it so that he reads his mail
                  normally (no new user mail).)


               The members of the Oblivion/2 team, and all Oblivion/2
          SysOps would like to thank you for your interest in
          Oblivion/2. I hope this documentation helped you resolve many
          of your problems with the BBS. Thank you for your support of
          Oblivion/2, the leader in telecommunications excellence!
