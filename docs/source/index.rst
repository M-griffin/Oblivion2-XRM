Development Goals
=================
The initial goal is to implement all legacy system actions in use on the default setup/install.
With options for extended customization added later on to keep progress going.


Progress Notes
===============
Screen shot showing some of the latest work on the menu system.
The default theme template and menu prompt in action while switching menus.
The menu system is still pretty raw and a lot of logic still needs to be completed.
