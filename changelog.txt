+ Testing Arch Linux Port of ARM.  Found some issues with OpenSSL
  Version 1.01 has changed it's API.  Corrections are now added
  to detect and handle newer and older API Calls for SHA1
  Which can probably be removed later on also.. Was testing a fix
  for Enthral as well.
- Other issues with Arch for ARM is GCC version 7, lots of new 
  and crazy warnings, needs to look into this.
- Note, the previous ARM setup was more for any Linux using GCC (Debian) Jessie
  with version 4.9 and lower.  the ARM folder will be renamed lateron for
  Compatibility of older distro's for now at least.
- Note, Codelite will build and compile on Arch ARM which has the latest
  libs and features.. One plus, other is that doc's suck and you have to 
  keep recompiling and adding missing libs as you go for just about everything
  in Arch.. haha.

+ Updated User Records and Database Schema for Control Flags, Should have been
  Integer for Bit values instead of a string
+ Fixed issue with Sysop menu and the pre gosysop menu that is suppose to ask
  for sysop password.  The prompt is not yet setup for input, bit the menu
  will no longer get stuck when trying to return to the starting menu
+ Fixed issue with menu prompts, when the menu was changing the system was 
  executing the clean input (used for when menu command return without execution
  the system will clear the input text on the screen.  Added a check if the menu
  changes to no longer attempt to clear input text since everything is re-drawn
  this will no longer overwrite the menu prompt.
+ Tested Changes in Linux, Updated Linux project and refreshed build folder.
+ Fixed and updates were done for Theme Colors and Users Colors for Yes/No Bars
  Make sure to remove the xrm-config.yaml and users.sqlite3 database and let the 
  system recreate and re-apply as a new user for correct colors on lightbars.

Change Log Update (00.00.78)
* 2017-03-15
+ Corrected Issues with YES/NO Lightbar padding on pipe and control color codes.
  The system now parses these to ANSI ESC Sequences prior to screen drawing
  so they are no longer pushed forward.
+ Also Added in user's theme colors for yes/no prompts.
+ Newuser signup now properly assigns the logged in user to the session.
+ Corrected Theme color being pull from config instead of signed on users record.
+ Newuser creation now sets user defaults pulling from default configuration colors.
+ Default colors are now pulled from configuration, and set to the initial instantiation 
  of the user record using default system theme colors until the user logs in and the 
  system takes over using the user's default theme colors.
+ Corrected final issue with stacked commands and menu changes.  If the menu changes 
  while processing stacked commands, we need to then exist the loop gracefully and 
  no longer attempt to execute or loop commands that no longer exist.

Change Log Update (00.00.77)
* 2017-03-12
+ Finished Initial Update for Single Lightbar Menu prompts.
+ Corrected some issues with Stacked Commands on these special case menus.
+ Removed CRLF after ENTER on lightbars menus is used, commands not executed 
  should not push the screen and keep the same display.
+ Updated Login prompts, this mean the build folder will be updated and/or 
  the login.yaml should be removed and regenerated with new defaults.
+ Corrected issues in AnsiProcessor with last line calculations.
  Updates last line used detection methods so the single line prompts
  will now display properly under the menu prompt.
- WIP have to look at the quit menu option or fallback in the sysop menu, 
  Quit is not returning to the menu that called it.

Change Log Update (00.00.76)
* 2017-03-06 / 2017-03-09
+ Fixed Several Linux display issues due to lapse in testing in this environment 
  once functionally was added.
+ Fixed Issues with Generic Menu Template Display, Top and Mid.  Some old DOS 
  system save clear screens with just ESC2J so had to add a ESC[1;1H to move 
  to cursor to the top of the screen.
+ Also Fix MID ansi issues where some telnet clients will wrap ESC[C right 
  cursor pushes. However, the Linux terminal will wait at the end of the line 
  until a displayable character is found.  This is not fixed to check in between 
  spacing sequences for ANSI optimizations.
+ Also refactored and some code cleanup.  Some generic some was added and might 
  be moved to the common libraries lateron if it's needed by future systems.
+ Tested and corrected issues with yaml message prompts.  Instead of letting 
  YAML write the output which force converts to UTF-8. We now write out the 
  yaml format manually when it comes to menu prompts.. All text prompts have %DF 
  for displaying files and don't need too much high ASCII. However if the need arises, 
  can work out some MCI codes where the file will write out yaml and MCI codes will 
  be replaces with CP437 sequences.  Add to the TODO list!
+ Fixes For Bottom of Used Screen Detection, Thanks to Putty and 24 Lines 
  Was able to test and fix a detection issue and now new prompts will 
  properly show under the menu prompt on any screen length.
+ Created New MenuPromptConvert project for converting legacy Menu Prompt Data to 
  individual .yaml files
+ Create Model and DAO's for new Menu Prompt Layouts and the new code is plugged in
  and working nicely
- Update MenuPrompt out of yaml to save as raw text to keep CP437 encoding. YAML 
  forces UTF-8 output which will corrupt the CP437 characters saved.
+ Also added random menu prompts when no prompt is selected as an option.
+ Updated User Record / Database table, changing menu prompt from an int index to 
  the name of the file for easier lookup and selection.

Change Log Update (00.00.75)
* 2017-02-06
+ Updated Build (Data Files) Archive which is linked on the Wiki.
  Fixed some display issues with default file menu settings, Some stacked
  commands should have been marked hidden.
+ Corrected Issues with Starting and Fallback menus, Now able to pass through
  From Message / Scan, and Quick Back to Main
  From File / Scan, and Quick Back to Main without issues.
+ Updated Menu Templates, no longer forcing a New line between mid and end screens
  The end template should add a CR is one is desired.
- Single line Bar Menu's are will a WIP.

Change Log Update (00.00.74)
* 2017-01-05
+ Quick Fix, on %%DF Filename display in text prompts.
+ Also added .ASC file load if .ANS is not found.

Change Log Update (00.00.73)
* 2017-01-04
+ mod prompts (Signup, Login, Pre-Login) setting up default prompt theme colors
  will also carry over to menu's to match system/user preference colors.
+ Added max screen rows used, so we can pull the lines drawn on the screen
  then display the prompt by default under the last items draw no matter where the cursor is.
+ Large refactoring of all Modules (Signup, Login, Pre-Login), go rid of some code smells
  and reorganized methods to have better naming to cut down on comments needed.
+ Reformatted all module text prompts to use default theme colors, pipe colors can stuff work
  but now everything is customizable by default on system color settings.  More on this to come.
+ Fixed lightbar drawing issues on pull down menu's.. most noticeable was the matrix menu.
- Mocked up the yes/no light bars, still a WIP
- Need to switch input to hotkey for N Menu functions.
- Started working on text prompt formatting for unformatted strings, default coloring for 
  strings not using pipe colors to add some configurable default feel to the system
- Added |PD in text prompts, this will display the prompt description (XRM Special)
  Users can add extra notes or instructions in the description of the prompt and display it along 
  with the text.
  
Change Log Update (00.00.72)
* 2016-12-21
+ Issues with Sysop menu corrected, it was actually a C++ issue looping vectors.
  Correct other container looks even through they weren't showing issues
  Better Safe then Sorry!  
+ Implemented more menu switching logic, for commands that change and skip execution
  of FIRSTCMD keys.
+ Started on Special Menu Action Prompts, menu's that display a special string with control
  characters and get prompt with lightbars yes/no, or other user input.  this will
  take some time to complete, as there is a lot of logic to all of the options.
+ Add masking for output on login password and the newuser passwords
+ Also started implementing theme color logic for prompt strings
  parsing the following control sequences for system or user selected colors.
  ^R - Regular Color      ^S - Status Color
  ^P - Prompt Color       ^E - Input Color
  ^V - Inverse Color      ^X - Box Color
  ^M - Goes down a line
- Main focus right now is on menu options and switching between menu and getting all 
  custom logic going.  

Change Log Update (00.00.71)
* 2016-12-19
+ Started Working -/ and -\ Menu Loading commands for switching menu's.
  Initial tests are working good.  Sysop menu didn't want to load but all
  others appear to be working properly.  Will look into the Sysop menu!
+ Corrected some overdraw issues from the screen buffer for MID ANSI's.
  '\0' Null characters or not plotted characters in the buffer were defaulting
  to spaces. When the MID ansi codes are drawn out these spaces would then over
  write the left and ride borders of the ANSI templates.  Instead i not loop
  and check for a sequence of \0 characters, then push out ESC[C to move
  the cursor forward instead of overwriting.  ANSI menu screens with templates
  are now displaying properly.
+ Menu Option Ordering, YAML does not guarantee that Sequences are loaded in the 
  same order they are present in the file.  Updated the Menu DAO (Data Access Object)
  to now sort by the index field assigned to all menu options to keep the proper 
  ordering.

Change Log Update (00.00.70)
* 2016-12-18
+ Started Shelling Menu Option Commands
  Started On Control Commands which handles allot of the core menu
  features like switching menu's, setting fallbacks, and displaying strings.
+ Incremented Config File Version to 1.0.1, added new fields
  for invalid_password_attempts, and invalid_newuser_password_attempts
  to avoid endless loops and when to kick out on invalid attempts.

Change Log Update (00.00.69)
* 2016-12-18
+ Re-synced Linux Workspace
+ Corrected and Updated Unit Tests for Field Input

Change Log Update (00.00.68)
* 2016-12-18
+ Completed Function Mapping for All Menu Command Functions.
  Used std::map to easily use a lookup by the first command key value.
  allot cleaner then a switch statement.

Change Log Update (00.00.67)
* 2016-12-17
+ Started Menu Commands Controls for Functions we need to build out
  Still a work in progress, might go with dynamic function array
  instead of long switch statements.  But that's just fancy
  and doesn't really do much.

Change Log Update (00.00.66)
* 2016-12-17
+ Added MCI Code parsing for Menu Prompt. Pulling the Menu Prompt
  Field for Menu Name, Added Time Left, and Time Now

+ Some Menu System/Base Code Refactoring, Variable Name Cleanup
  Working to keep better design and naming principals

Change Log Update (00.00.65)
* 2016-12-14
+ Fixes for MID Ansi Template Processing, Now uses internal
  Ansi Processor for parsing implied ESC Sequences ESC[;20H
  where the missing sequence is considered the current row
  instead of default row 1.  We draw the screen internally
  then push out the processed screen for correct drawing.
  
Change Log Update (00.00.64)
* 2016-11-30
+ Menu Option Cleanup and split out to separate methods.

  passed in to the Code Map for different screens.
  Makes it easier to setup different screens and their
  custom MCI code replacements per interface.
+ Completed Generic Menu Template processing.  When the
  Menu HelpId is empty, or no ansi exist the Generic 
  Template is used for Top, Mid, and Bottom.  All
  valid Menu options are then populated. Drawing the 
  Menu ANSI Screen. This is also used for the Menu 
  Library's and Selectable Themes across the system.
+ Added some Missing Include for Boost Lexical Cast.
+ Corrected missed parsing on Pull down Menu Hotkey's.
- Initial Menu Prompts are pulling and are displayed.

  Still small things for validation, some stuff for detection needed for backspace
  and then the final verify and save.  After that can start on the logon process.

Change Log Update (00.00.45)
* 2016-08-22
+ Added Several Updates and Fixes for Linux/OSX Terminals
+ Corrected Telnet Options for Echoing back and removing line mode
+ Removed check for duplicate options, so we can call more then one
  and expect just as many replies without endless loops.  Tested Good.
+ Added Clear Screen and home cursor for initial screen positions to match
  the local screen buffer.
+ For ansi screens in windows, replaced \n with \r\n on parsing ansi files.
  (Should also add detection if just \r or replace with \r\n also.
+ WIP need to add screen size change detection, if the screen size changes 
  we need to redraw the screen but also resize the local screen buffer to match
  so lightbar are still in the correct positions!  Important, but not vital just yet.

Change Log Update (00.00.44)
* 2016-08-21
+ Moved regexp fields expressions to the config file.
  Plan is to allow custom expressions for fields like handles and passwords etc..
+ Completed a few more new user app questions things.
+ Added Challenge Question/Answers to the Security Table for lost password
  If users don't like waiting on emails, etc, then can be ask a secondary question
  to reset their password. (Should we have multiple questions)?  One good for now.

Change Log Update (00.00.43)
* 2016-08-21
+ Created Security Table, Model and Dao for storing password and salt hashes
  per user.  This will have a foreign key linked to the user record.
+ Setup the tables in main and tested the dao
+ More updates to the signup process, added date validation
+ Plugged in the encryption hashing for passwords
+ Also Added ESC Sequences for proper CP437 to UTF-8 selection for Terminal Support

Change Log Update (00.00.42)
* 2016-08-19
+ Added Enum to config for standard field lengths for limiting field input
  by the same length through the program without having to hard code in each area.
+ Reworked AnsiProcessor to smart pointer and passes to all modules.  This keeps 
  track of all screen data output so we know locally where the screen's x/y position
  is.  This is important for advanced screen redraws and MCI code parsing of positions 
  on the fly.
+ Completed more work and refining on the new user application
+ Added in initial user database setup on startup and setup for creating new users 
  in the sign up process.
+ Signup process is still a WIP.
+ Also plugged in the ansi processor to the modules, all output should be sent through
  the local screen buffer to we can pick up MCI codes on screens at any point in the scroll
  This allows dynamic lightbar on any screen without hard coding specific positions!

Change Log Update (00.00.41)
* 2016-08-11
+ Reworked inputField to handle pass through data properly.  
+ Reworked so Backspace, Del, and ESC Sequences are not echoed back

+ Some more testing needed on c++ conversions of hex values.

Change Log Update (00.00.38)
* 2016-04-10
+ Update the ConfigDao object to update the smart pointer when loading the config file
  Modules now have access to the loaded values, might be able to switch this to copy/move
  constructor lateron, but looks good for now.
+ Added use_newuser_password and use_disclaimer to the config files for signup items.
  If they are enabled, they will be displayed and use in the signup process.
+ Update the menu system on command execution via ENTER and Hotkey to now execute the 
  command match the command key sequence.  The matrix menu is the test bed, and is now 
  kicking off the new user application when hitting A or ENTER on Apply for new.
+ Still working on the input handling for all of the signup fields now.

Change Log Update (00.00.37)
* 2016-04-06
+ Updated Modules.  Main will check and create a fresh config file if it doesn't exist.
  The config file is loaded one the menu system starts and is now passed through
  to each module for access.
+ Reordered the Detection phases.  Terminal options are detected, however they are now displayed
  after the Emulation is detected.
+ Work can now start on the New User Signup.

Change Log Update (00.00.36)
* 2016-04-05
+ Converted the Configuration to from Boost XML serialization to YAML
  Updated both the config.hpp and config_dao objects

Change Log Update (00.00.35)
* 2016-03-31
+ Added more code in SessionIO to check if ANSI emulations is not enabled, then 
  Ignore PIPE color codes in prompts and pipe2ansi replace methods.
+ Started working on Signup Module for New User Applications
  Finished a lot of the initial method stubs and virtual functions
  Working on prompts on key/value descriptions
  Added check for Disclaimer and new user password.
- Next will also rewrite the system configuration from serialized xml to .yaml
  to make manual configuration and testing much easier.

Change Log Update (00.00.34)
* 2016-03-30
+ If ANSI is not detected, and ASCII NO Color is selected, .ASC screens are then
  loaded instead of .ANS and menu pull down lightbars are disabled for normal menu
  keys.

Change Log Update (00.00.33)
* 2016-03-28
+ Completed most of the stub for Logon Module for Login and Password Sequences
  Database lookup for user and password must be completed.  However, the signup
  and accounts needs to be created first for test.
+ Create Module Signup, initial stubbing completed for new user application.
- Also setup Session_Data->Emulation for ANSI or ASCII no color.
  Have to work out the stubs for removing all pipe color codes from prompts when
  in ASCII mode instead of having separate prompts.  Same with ANSI screens .ASC instead of .ANS
  default will be generic menus.  Test with Matrix first.

Change Log Update (00.00.32)
* 2016-03-27
+ Completed Use Codepage selections in PreLogon Module.
+ PreLogon module is now completed with initial detection phases.
  Moving on to the Logon Module for the Matrix login, and NewUser Module
  for new user accounts.
+ Adding CR\LF replacement to LF on incoming data.  Windows Console Telnet
  Likes to send CR\LF for [ENTER] instead of a single key.

Change Log Update (00.00.31)
* 2016-03-27
+ Working on more of the PreLogon process, When ANSI is not detected it will
  ask to use colors or ASCII no color.  Next need to work on codepage output
  CP437 or UTF-8.  
- Also look at the NEW_ENV Telnet options when I get some more time.

Change Log Update (00.00.30)
* 2016-03-27
+ Worked out NEW_ENV Telnet options were locking up Windows Console Telnet.
  For now I've commented this out to look into at a later date.

Change Log Update (00.00.29)
* 2016-03-26
+ Prompts are not working for Terminal Detection (Telnet Option Parsing)
  When completed, now displays detected terminal 'ansi' and size '80x25' etc..
+ Prelogon Emulation Detection is working, sending ESC[6n and getting a response
  from the client,  ESC[xx;xxR for current X/Y Position showing the client 
  can use ESC sequence
+ Also added a new Detection Timer for 1.5 seconds to receive client response
  for ESC[6n query.
+ Prompts are now setup to show Emulation Detected results
- Left off on asking for ANSI Color when detection fails
- Left off on asking Encoding CP437 or UTF-8

Change Log Update (00.00.28)
* 2016-03-25
+ Created New Mod_PreLogon to handle pre-logon sequences like Emulation and Term Detection.
+ Reworking the Setup / Input methods per the modules right now.  
+ Moved the Initial Global Text Prompts out of Communicator to the PreLogon Modules to where
  they will be used.
+ Added parseFilename to session_io to handle text prompts with %%FILENAME.EXT MCI code
  This will parse and loaded the file name given in a prompt and display a file in the
  prompt string.
+ Communicator added Telnet Option detection global prompts.  So show when the client/server
  are communicates on options negotiation.
+ Removed new user functions from the Login Module, I'll create a new user module later next.
+ Removed SystemState, this wasn't being used as the MenuSystem is now called as the main state,
  More status will be added lateron for other "Services" once the main system is completed
  or further along.

Change Log Update (00.00.27)
* 2016-03-24
+ Update to main, moved path setup before the communicator is called so it has valid paths for
  creating / reading global text prompts.
+ Updated session: added a deadline detection timer for Telnet negotiations.  
  on connection the session should wait at least 1.5 seconds before starting the state
  so that any terminal detection can be negotiated and detected before starting the login process.
+ Also updated the state, if were in the detection phase, and the state is not yet created
  then any input received is put on hold until the state is ready.

Change Log Update (00.00.26)
* 2016-03-24
+ Created global prompt that are shared system wide, they are accessed via the communicator object
  for easy of use and access, global prompt keys are created in the data/structures file
  while each module with have it's specific in their own mod_xxx.hpp file.

Change Log Update (00.00.25)
* 2016-03-24
+ mod_logon now has the initial read/write of module specific text prompts
  basic setup will check on creation of class if file exists, if not it will create
  with defaults.  The Module will load each prompt file on startup so to minimize disk i/o
  when grabbing different prompts throughout the lifetime of the object.
- Should create a global text prompt handler as well.  Things like Pause, or hit a key
  and other misc text prompts should not be duplicated across modules.
  
Change Log Update (00.00.24)
* 2016-03-24
+ Created new text_prompt_dao to handle reading and writing prompts for all modules
+ Each module with have it's own short and simple prompt file, this is a general
  template to handle all modules

Change Log Update (00.00.23)
* 2016-03-23
+ Realigned the state code files to standard naming convention

Change Log Update (00.00.22)
* 2016-03-23
+ Renamed Broad_Caster to Session_Manager to better describe what it does.
+ Various cleanup and re-organization.
+ Also removed directory_bbs from config, the main root folder will always 
  be detected from where the executable is launched.

Change Log Update (00.00.21)
* 2016-03-23
+ Moved OBV/2 DAO's to compat sub folder to separate data access to original OBV/2 data files vs
  the current new data access objects.
+ These functions will be used later on for writing conversions.

Change Log Update (00.00.20)
* 2016-03-23
+ Created new Model sub folder to separate structures from data access objects.
+ Updated all files to the new model path
+ Added NewUserApplication stub for ModLogin 
+ Currently building out text prompt reading, Initial idea is to have single function in dao.
  Then each mod will have it's own separate file of prompts which it will pass to the dao
  to quick read module specific text prompts.

Change Log Update (00.00.19)
* 2016-03-21
+ Rename MenuManager to StateManager to reflect what it does.
+ Removed unused or old files
+ Working on Logon Module for initial login process, also testing yaml for login prompts.

Change Log Update (00.00.18)
* 2016-03-18
+ Remove Initial Stub for Language File
  Change this to Prompts_Dao, Moved to Data Folder, working on reading the OBV/2 
  Language file for prompts so I can convert this to an easier format to work
  With, later on will write an update for existing prompts.

Change Log Update (00.00.17)
* 2016-03-17
+ Added popping modules off stack when menu system is closed down!
+ Added new shutdown state cleaning in the Session Destructor to make sure the 
  Menu System and all active modules are shutdown per RAII properly.
+ Update Module Login to pass Instantiate SessionIO class for handle key input

Change Log Update (00.00.16)
* 2016-03-17
+ Created new Mods Sub folder to store system modules
  All modules will be containers of system functions like mod_login for login procedures
  mod_messages for message, mod_files for files, mod_bbslist etc.. 
  Each module will contain it's own asynchronous input processing and output
  And everything will pass through from Session->MenuSystem->Modules
+ Bit of rework on the Menu System, changes passing character_buffer and bools to const references.
+ Added new startupModuleLogon() and moduleInput() for dynamic and asynchronous processing. 

Change Log Update (00.00.15)
* 2016-03-16
+ Moved Menu and Structures to Data Folder
+ Rename MenuData to MenuDao for Data Access Object.
+ Working out how the login process will work from the menu system
- Also need to determine layout for language files, multiple languages / themes.

Change Log Update (00.00.14)
* 2016-03-16
+ Reworking the Menu System and Ironing out the functionality
+ Created executeMenuOptions() to handle processing command keys from input.
+ Setting processMenuOptions() to taken input and pass to execute
- Working default startup to check configuration for Matrix or normal logon.
  Then setting up the startup menu properly.  
- Building initial login with apply as new first
- Looking at best way to handle language file for prompts, thinking key value map
  is much better then int indexes, don't have to worry about order ever!

Change Log Update (00.00.13)
* 2016-03-15
+ Cleaned up some Menu System Items
+ Need to add startup to matrix, and test for configuration value if it's enabled.
+ Start building out matrix menu, and new user application next!

Change Log Update (00.00.12)
* 2016-03-13
+ Config file will auto generate with defaults if it doesn't exist.
+ Using new Config Class and DAO to read config file. Remove references to Config.BBS
  which wasn't being used.
+ Telnet and SSL Sockets listeners are now swapped depending on configuration settings.
* 2016-03-14
+ Reworked the Configuration a bit more, removed passing configurations though the servers to the sessions
  This could cause sessions to stick with smart pointers, instead worked it into the Global Communicator
  Which will pass back a weak pointer of the config anytime it's needed since it's global and static.
+ Also added mutex and lock guards to the configuration.

Change Log Update (00.00.11)
* 2016-03-13 Long Break is Over
+ Started laying out Database Tables, decided to stick with custom version of SqliteWrapped.
* SqliteWrapped:
+ Makes lots of updates and have been rewriting SqliteWrapped to work a little 
  easer with classes and help make some ORM related adjustments for pulling data 
  in and out of classes easier.
+ Added transactional inserts, updates, and creates, failures can no be rolled back
  and makes for quicker inserts of large data sets, and also creating tables and indexes together.
* XRM: 
+ Created a new Data Sub folder and initial data classes for Config and Users.
  Also created Config_Dao, and Users_Dao which will maintain the API for reading and writing data.
+ Config file is setup as a serialization class that will read and write to an XML file.
+ Users is setup to use the custom SQLite Wrappers API and updated features and methods.
- Work has been a little start as my time is still limited.  I have to rip out allot of the 
  flat file stuff I did and start writing interfaces for the data, then later on write conversions 
  from the flat files to the new data layouts.
- Then i also need to decide what format the menu files will be in.  It's kind of silly to use a 
  database for menu files. So either XML, JSON, or something that is quick and easy to edit and use. 

Change Log Update (00.00.10)
+ Note, SSL ipv6, and Telnet Options.

* 2015-11-05 Import to Sqlite
+ Starting on Initial Functions for Import.
- Started on Menu while also look through and testing Sqlitewrapped.
  Need to do some testing on writing and retrieving Dates from
  The Database.

* 2015-11-01 Obv2 Data Files
+ Breaking out functions for reading original obv/2 data files
  to a new update2xrm sub folder.  This is will be used for 
  upgrading legacy obv2 systems to the new xrm format once 
  it's completed.  Namespaecs will be created for different
  obv/2 versions as needed.  Default is 2.30, plans for adding
  2.4 etc for Black Flag and more.

* 2015-10-26 Sqlite3 Schema.
+ Worked on more tables and splitting out sections.
+ Working on some database inserts and performance testing.
- Goal is squeeze out the best layout that will run optimally on Pi/2 ARM
  and be well optimized for all platforms there after.

* 2015-10-22 Sqlite3 Schema.
+ Currently Breaking down the User And System Records into Tables
  Pretty tedious but need to normalized it out.


Change Log Update (00.00.09)
* 2015-10-19 XRM-WFC and SSL Connections
+ Large rework on the Session, SessionData and Connection objects
  Worked new SSL connections into exiting Session and SessionData
  Classes over the same pipes normal sessions.
+ Connections are now Stable over both TCP and SSL at the same time
  after combining sessions.
- Some more SSL client testing.
- Linux Makefiles are out of date with new files, and includes
  These Makefiles will need to be remade as time permits.

* 2015-10-17 SQL ORM Research
+ Looking into several different sqlite3 wrappers for some ORM
  or Object Relational Mapping.  After hours of compiling and
  some initial testing I'm decide to use the current SqliteWrapped
  wrapper which gives full query control. SOCI I checked out more and
  seemed to have several issues when working with classes and exceptions
  which killed the program every time.

* 2015-10-16 XRM-WFC and SSL Connections
+ SSL Connections are now working correctly with signed cert's.
+ XRM-WFC client is able to send and receive messages from the 
  BBS server over SSL. And will have both a server and client.
  Sysop's will be able to connect up and join a global sysop
  chat, link systems, transfer mail over secure connections.
  That is the idea, still more to come!
- Still in initial test stages, needs quite a bit more refinement.
  Also look at Database ORM's SOCI is looking pretty nice and is
  under the boost licence as well.

* 2015-10-15 Added SSL Secure System to System Connections.
+ Started Oblivion/2 XRM Client_SSL Test will merge into the 
  Waiting for Caller remote admin Interface.
  - This is for local system configuration, viewing users only, 
    Internal Sysop messaging network possibly a lot more.

Change Log Update (00.00.08)
* 2015-10-12 Unit Tests & Code Refactoring.
+ Completed 17 more unit tests for a total of 80 passing.
+ Continue to refine IO classes to make sure all input is processed correct
  This is for both standard CP437 and UTF-8.

Change Log Update (00.00.07)
* 2015-10-11 Unit Tests & Code Refactoring.
+ Working on next method for SessionIO, Added start of 
  ScreenBuffer testing for AnsiProcessor.
+ 63 Unit Tests so far. Only had a little time tonight
+ Various updates to Session and CommonIO

Change Log Update (00.00.06)
* 2015-10-09 Unit Tests & Start ARM Makefiles
+ Updates some Test Names, and Started UnitTests for AnsiProcessor.
+ Testing and working on ARM Makefiles for Pi/2 in Raspbian.
  More preliminary researching on what needs to be done.
- Small issues with outdated packages, Sqlite3 is 3.7.13, and 
  we need at least 3.7.14 for sqlite3_close_v2 UTF8 version.
  This is from 2012,  a little outdated Debian, I think so!
- gcc also needs to be at least 4.8.x for c++11 support.
  default is like 4.6 maybe 4.7.  I upgraded this a long time ago.
- Will eventually put together some apt-get install command lines
  that will pull all required dependency packages for quick builds.
  However, ARM builds will take some manual updating. :)

Change Log Update (00.00.05)
* 2015-10-09 Unit Tests 
+ Started Units Test on SessionIO

+ Ported To Linux for cross compiler testing.
+ Create new Makefile(s) for Linux builds
  - make -f Makefile-linux will build all (3) projects in order.
     - SqliteWrapped, xrm-server, xrm-unittests
  - Requires Boost, Pthreads, Sqlite3 libs.  Tested in Ubuntu/Mint
  - Moved compiler flags down from 14 to 11 standards.
+ Made small updates via compiling in Linux to code.

Change Log Update (00.00.01)
* 2015-10-08 UnitTests
+ Commented out Tests already pre-written.  I need to go through
  and update all tests to the current layout.

Change Log Update (00.00.00)
* 2015-10-08 Cleanup and Git.
* Moved all Source files to src sub folder.
+ Cleaned up files no longer part of the project.

  to separate specific menu operations.
- Starting on LanguageFile imports and string editor for all configurable 
  prompts.

Change Log Update
* 2015-10-07 MenuSystem WIP
+ Initial Light bar display and movement, and selection are all working
+ Menu handling now working for FIRSTCMD and EVERY on menu  
  returns.
+ Split out Menu DataFile Templates for obv/2 data files to new 
  MenuData Class.  MenuSystem is growing as the core and need to keep
  everything organized.
+ Each Menu Loaded will have a fresh AnsiProcessor instance. 
  This instance keeps track of all pull-down / template screen for 
  parsing special MCI function codes by parsing and building an std::map
  to make a Key Value store of each screen pixel position, pixel in this
  context in a single character on the screen with color, attribute and 
  position data.

- NOTES: Right now up and left move to previous, and down and right
  move to next light bar.  OBV/2 has overwrite for left and right so assign
  with menu commands.. so you can have up and down, or left and right
  toggle bars.. or split out to other menu commands.  Need to add this in.
- Need to Add menu command for override of starting pull-down ID.
- Add Cursor Toggle to hide the cursor when displaying light bars 
  And/Or move to Menu Prompt location.  Also pull in selected menu
  prompt if available.

Change Log Update
* 2015-10-06 MenuSystem
+ Building the light bar menu processing for handling input and hotkey's
  menu items.  Stacked command triggers.  ENTER on light bar selections
  and arrow key movements with HOME and END to jump beginning/end
  of command options.
+ Completed methods for Menu Screen redraws without re-processing.
  Clear screen, Draw out initial light bars. Method of redrawing
  light bar movement updates.  
+ Started handling of FIRSTCMD and EACH command keys for executing
  menu commands the first time menu loads, or EACH TIME a command
  completes and returns back to the menu. 

* Items on the next Todo list:
-------------------------------------
- Still a lot more menu system work.  Handling normal menus without 
  pull- down and field input. 
- Access Control Systems with security levels and flags.
- handling menu prompts defaults and sets.
- handling menu themes defaults and sets.

Change Log Update
* 2015-10-05 Code Cleanup and Refactoring
+ Cleaning up some initial dev code for AnsiProcessor and ScreenBuffer.

Change Log Update
* 2015-10-05 Internal Screen Buffer - WIP
+ Completed screen buffer parsing.  Now have X/Y Coords and Colors of 
  Special MCI sequences for Light bars in menu screen
+ System is now processing the MATRIX Menu for pull down commands
  then parsing the ANSI for the X/Y Coords and colors of each 
  light bar state.  on/off.. 
- Can layout the low-light bars and active for the high-light bar.  
  Need to add a looping to change back and forth between commands
  then setup command execution and processing.
- Verify OBV/2 light bar ordering.  Does is height by order in menu options
  or does it order by pulldownID index.  My bet is on the first one. 

Change Log Update
* 2015-10-04 Internal ANSI Parser - WIP
+ Screen buffer is processing menu ANSI now. With redraw of screen
  from the buffer.  
- Working on parsing character buffer for light bar position for cycling them
  in a menu.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-29 Internal ANSI Parser - WIP
+ Reworking to maintain internal x/y Coords and colors attributes
  of the users screen. Rewriting the color ESC sequence parsing.
- Finished Color and Attribute Tracking. Implementing Clear Screen,
  (3) Ways, Entire, from cursor and above, from cursor and below.
  Then adding in Erase from Cursor to End of Line, From Cursor to begging.
- Add in pre-search in Pipe2Ansi for MCI codes so we know when to pull 
  color and position attributes from the screen buffer.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-28 StateSystem & Internal ANSI Parser
+ Reconfigured the Session->StateMachine->State->MenuSystem hierarchy.
  Cleaned up to Session->MenuManager->MenuSystem
  The MenuSystem is a now a State itself which easily inherits the 
  SessionData Class when created through MenuManager.  This keeps it
  nice and clean without circular dependencies tripping up.
+ a Modified StateSystem will now be used from the MenuSystem
  When calling out to other interfaces that need to be instantiated
  and kept alive once the system returns for the next async_input loop.
- Started on Internal ANSI screen buffer.  This is needed to process
  all ANSI screens for special MCI position codes which tell the system
  where and what colors to place lightbars or input boundaries for 
  split screen chat.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-27 Menu System
+ Completed new Dynamic function mapping for the menu system.
  Each menu function will have (2) functions to work asynchronously.
  a startup...() method for each system will be used to switch over the 
  input index to the selected system and also handle any initial setup 
  and screen displays for that specific interface. While state->update() 
  method passing input to the menu system will do a lookup and pass 
  all incoming data for processing to the specific method awaiting input.

+ Tested switching back and forth between the default menu input and menu 
  editor input without any issues.  Fast and smooth! 
- Now that the base of the menu system is laid out. Work is starting on the 
  actual interfaces for both the default menu, and menu editor.

Change Log Update  
* 2015-09-25 MCI Codes
+ New Parser is up to speed with the old one parsing all menu prompt
  Codes for movement and colors along with ClearScreen and NewLines.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-24 IPv6 and IPv4
+ Server will now listens and accepts both IPv6 and IPv4 connections.
  If the system doesn't support IPv6, it will default to an IPv4 listener only.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-23 MCI Codes Parsing and Regex
+ Completed the initial parsing of MCI Codes with new Regex Parser
  Thanks Bryan for the extra help and cool validator site!
+ Added Enum system to the MCI Codes parser, some interfaces and 
  screens have different MCI Codes, for examples menu prompts,
  status screen, upload checked. This will parsed for specific codes
  per interface.
+ Broke out parsing for PipesColors to separate function.
- Finished Parsing Pipe Colors.
- Parser is still a WIP at this time will finish up the general codes
  for colors and positions to move back to building the Editors.
- Regex parser is also important for ACS Levels and Flags once the menu
  system is going.

* 2015-09-22 Communicator
+ Adding System wide configuration Structs to the singleton.  
  This is for global configuration variable access to all sessions.
+ Moved PascalToCString, CStringToPascal, BoolToString to CommonIO.
+ Added Functions to Communicator to read the CONFIG.BBS record.
+ Started Exit Error Codes, First is if the Config file can not be loaded.
+ Completed import for Config record with updates from Pascal to 
   C-Strings.
+ Changed MenuIO to SessionIO as it's more generalized for all interfaces.
   With Pipe2Ansi, and MCI Code Parsing and GetKey, GetInputField ...
TODO Notes:
- Break out MenuEditor to new Object from MenuSystem
  + Break out Read/Write Functions to MenuIO
- Break out ConfigEditor to new Object from Communicator
  + Break out Read/Write Functions to ConfigIO
Making these Objects callable from the MenuSystem itself.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-21 MenuIO.
+ Created New MenuIO object with SessionData
+ Added High Level GetKey, GetInputField, 
  CreateInputField: generates ANSI background color at specified length
  for Inputting data for specific amount of characters.
  pipe2ansi for MCI and Pipes sequence parser.
  ANSI foreground and background colors method for pipe2ansi.
+ Input Fields will have override for Foreground/Background colors with
  MCI codes along with Field Length.
+ Some minor code refactoring to keep naming the same across the
  board
+ Ran CppCheck to clean up any thing missed and unused variables.

- Looking at the best way to handle function calls in the menu system
  Looking at a map of function pointers to dynamically shift
  what methods receive input and to shift what is active.
- Also looking into Output Deadline timer for timing out of delayed ANSI
  Screen.  This will include long scrollers and Ansimation.
  Might need to add this to a separate thread so other nodes are not
  delayed as well as the node displaying the ANSI on a timer.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-21 SessionData Object and Core IO Working.
+ All Core IO and Deadline timer session objects are now in SessionData.
  SessionData is now working nicely being passed through the states.
  Clean shutdown of the system through the Singleton to loop each session
  and disconnect all connections properly is completed for maint shutdowns.
+ Getline/Field Input is done.  Add a Hotkey toggle with easy to use functions 
  for handing input.

Next Initial Items to complete:
- WIP - Pass SessionData to menu system now
- WIP - Add Output i/o for Esc Sequences, MCI Code Parsing and ANSI Screens.
- Test CP437 to UTF-8 output translations for *Nix/OSX terminal display.
- Finish building Menu Editor and System Configuration
- Start on Feature of the core menu system reading and handling commands
  And light bars.  Initial menu will start on Matrix for testing.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-20 SessionData Object And Core IO - WIP.
+ Most of the core IO has been moved over from the base Session class.
  Session data will link the StateMachine with session so that it 
  can change the state from within any interface. The Base Sessions
  keep pointers through the session alive and are kept alive itself via 
  the Broad_caster.
- Lots of work to rewrite the shutdown process. Now that the core IO is 
  In the SessionDate, this allows it to be passed and used through the entire system.  
  However, it now keep has it own Broad_caster link to keep node communication available.  
  Since this link is in both the Session and SessionData,  we can't just stop 
  and let all of the destructors work down. We now have to loop through all 
  connections and disconnect them all first to properly release the smart pointers, 
  then we can call the final io_service shutdown. Working some difference ideas 
  to handle this now after researching.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-19 Start of new SessionData Object
+ Doing callbacks in the main Session Class loop then passing buffers
  through each state and retrieving output back the same way with several 
  layers is very cumbersome! The new SessionData object using smart 
  pointers spawning per session and link the base io_session, and hold all 
  session specific data. This new object will then be passed through to 
  each state, then off to each menu, menu's method so that IO can be used 
  and accessed easily within the direct methods instead of data passed 
  through several layers.  This is how I envisioned the IO would work, just 
  took quite some time to get here properly learning ASIO since all examples
  work with the base class, it took some time to learn creating, passing
  with enabled_share_this() to other areas.
- Initial Output tested good, can now try moving the input to the new object
  with a Deadline timer for ESC sequence parsing.  Then add in pipe2ansi
  functions for colonizing the output.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-17 InputField processing III
+ Fixed InputField Issue, Not a bug in EtherTerm.  Issue was with fast key
  presses, the buffer had more then one key press.  The new system loops
  each incoming key and waits for a return from the method to push to the 
  screen if it's a valid key and not in the middle of ESC sequence. So 
  This now catches characters in the middle of loop.. to make sure it
  catches everything to output.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-17 InputField processing II
+ Found bug in EntherTerm! GetLine processing is working correctly.
+ Working on InputField Generate, which will take the prompt, add a lightbar
  Input field after the string for the length of the field, and pre-populate 
  with any text like when sending an email.. Email to: Mercyful Fate  will 
  then pre populate The input field with a foreground and back color.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-17 InputField processing I
+ Added Conversion from ESC Sequence to named string, ie ESC[A = up_arrow.
  Makes translations from different key mapping easier to handle.
  Thanks to Bryan for the extra rxvt sequences.
+ Completed single Key / ESC Sequence GetKey functions.
  Input is parsed for ESC determining is ESC has follow up sequence.  If
  a sequence is detected it continues gathering the remainder of the 
  sequence returning an ESC to notify either ESC key or Sequence.
  When it's a sequence the m_escape_sequence buffer will be empty for 
  a single ESC key, or populated with the string translation ie.. up_arrow.
- WIP InputField Processing. This uses the above GetKey Translations 
  and loops input on fields until an [ENTER] is received.  Handles ESC 
  to Abort field, CTRL+Y Clear and start over and BS/DEL to erase 
  characters.  Working out ASCII and UTF-8 friendly support.  
  WIP BS/DEL or erasing needs a little more tweaking. Made lots of progress.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-16 Async ESC Sequence Parsing
- Working out issues with breaking data asynchronously into ESC sequence
  patterns when characters are originally split first by ASCII vs UTF-8, 
  are only sent through one at a time. A Mechanism needs to be used to 
  notify if there is more data to determine if its an ESC vs. start of a 
  sequence.  
  NOTE: I don't like passing flags through classes for this.
+ Worked out ESC issue, on lone ESC key, we'll follow-up with a null '\0'
  right after to ESC to signal it's a lone ESC key after deadline checking.
  NULLS are parsed out on all incoming data, so this is perfect to
  single the end of a special character internally.
+ ESC vs ESC Sequences tested good with single and multiple sequences.
  With and without deadline checking. Looks like were good to continue
  more interface work at last!

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-15 Menu Editor
- Working on the Menu Editor input handling.  Added toggle for line or
  Hotkey input.  Default in OBV/2 is line input in most menus with
  Hotkey during pull down menus.  This will be a toggle for an added 
  feature.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-14 Input Processing
+ Added a Deadline timer per session. This is needed when the last char
  received is an ESC.  We need the ability to detect single ESC vs
  an ESC sequence. Lag over the Internet can receive broken sequences
  ESC in one read(), then [A in the next read().  With the timer, any
  time we receive an ESC by itself we wait 400 milliseconds for any follow 
  up sequence.  Otherwise it's registered as a lone ESC key.
  Without this, function key sequence can register as an ESC and exit allot
  of interfaces causing issues!  

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-13 Menu Editor
+ Working on Menu Editor and Input parsing, with toggle for line or hotkey
  input for menu interfaces.  Still WIP.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-08 Smart Pointers
+ Worked out some smart pointer passing issues with the state
  machine and passing session data from interfaces back to the users
  from inside different states.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-07 Menu Editor
+ Complete Initial Menu Directory parsing, and formatting the screen to 
  dynamically display all available menus for editing.
  Working on Edit, Save, Add, Delete options now.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-06 Started Menu I/O
+ Reading of MenuInfo and MenuOption Structs in .MNU files completed.
- Started working on Editor, will add some extra options for ? in CKeys
  to list all available with small descriptions when there is time.
  Makes it easier to mod. 

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-04 More State Machine and I/O
+ Worked out functionality of StateMachine will derive a menu system
  States will now involve more complete systems instead of sub modules
  Eg.. System State (BBS), Chat State (Sysop/Teleconference, 
  WFC State (Waiting for Callers, stats, node snooping).
  Each state will have a Menu system for handing commands and lightbars.
+ The State/MenuManager will loop incoming strings of data, parse single 
  ASCII characters vs UTF-8 multi-byte characters and feed them one
  at a time through to each interface. Interfaces will then be able to 
  parse sequences ASCII, ESC, or multi-byte sequences as needed.
+ Added some basic Node Tracking for sessions.  This way we can tell  who is 
  on which node, and also match these numbers to sessions for notifications 
  and chat and door games.
+ Started adding output for default out and translated CP347 to UTF-8 for
  terminals.  Eventually will look at encoding for other 8 bit types like
  ISO-8859-1, etc.. However, most of these do not do block and line
  drawing for ANSI.  At this time I'm keeping CP437 and UTF-8 with 
  possible expansions later on. (Keep it simple for now).
+ Starting on Menu Editor that will read and edit original OBV/2 menu files
  Goal is to handle menus and data exactly as OBV/2 does, then expand later
  on as needed and enrich it.  To also allow full working menu from OBV/2 
  systems with compatibility for all mods and custom work.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-02 Working on Sessions and State Machine
+ Each session now includes its own State Machine.  In this instance a state 
  Machine contains a base class, while each module will become a derived 
  class.  For Example, CONFIG, LOGIN, MESSAGES, FILES will each have its own 
  state and become a derived state class.
+ After lots of tinkering it's been decided (with possible future changes)
  to handle each state module in the following as we do not want to loop for
  Data or input inside any of the state modules.  The Session will pass all
  client input through the update() method.  The update() method will then
  process the input and return all output to the state_machine 
  or ie..The Manager.  which will then send all outback to the screen for
  the user to see the interaction awaiting input.
- Question on Changing the State from within a state.  Looking at the best
  way to handle state switching.  If we want to keep communication with a list 
  of each session, and when their state changes.  This way when in multi-node
  or who's on, we can easily list the users, and which state/module or action
  they are in.  I'm leaning more towards this, but need to test this out.

Change Log Update
* 2015-09-01 Working in Input character decoding.
+ Working on Input Parsing.  WIP
  - Completed Loop that reads buffer after Telnet Opts are parsed out
  - Next Checks for complete single characters ASCII vs UTF-8
  - Returns char commands or ESC with buffered ESC sequence for Function Keys
  - Tricky as original code was looking at TTY in *nix, now rewriting to 
    read buffered socket data directly.
+ Cleaned up some File naming
+ WIP handle_character_sequencing(), this need to loop all incoming data
  splitting out characters from sequences.  But also need to keep static 
  track of where it left off so no sequences or multi-byte characters 
  are lost.
+ Working on State Machine, each interface will be separated into states
  where the sessions will be passed and update() will be looped to process 
  input when data is received.
- NOTE: Still need to research async_wait() within a session and not main 
  thread. Need to add timeouts per session.

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-31 OBV/2 Data Structure (Initial Version 2.30) 2.35, 2.4x will follow
  For Data Conversions.
+ Completed Data Structures for MenuInfo, MenuOption, FileArea, 
  FileRecord, Protocol
+ Structures Completed so far w/ read/write function template:
  Statistics
  WFCO
  InfoformData
  ConfigRecord
  FDesAttrType
  EmailMessageRecord
  UserRecord
  MenuOption
  MenuInfo
  FileArea
  FileRecord
  Protocol

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-30 Session State
+ Adding Session State to tell if incoming data is for commands or 
  session/global chat.
+ Added session tracking for input and output character encoding
  Sessions start with CP437 default. I will try to test and add support
  for other options such as ISO-8859-1 etc.. Although they don't display ANSI
  options are nice to have later on.  Otherwise the main defaults are CP437 
  and UTF-8.
+ Output encoding will default to CP437 on ANSI term detection, UTF-8 on XTERM
  With global toggles between the two output translations.  Input will default to 
  UTF-8, with toggles for CP437 for pasting ANSI graphics characters.  

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-29 Encryption support for internal and user passwords.
+ Data should be encrypted before saved to sqlite3.

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-28 SQlite3 support for data.
+ Working in custom version of SqliteWrapped. Initial compile is now building
  in Windows, now testing reading and writing Unicode strings to the database.

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-27 Unicode or UTF-8 Internal support.
+ Started adding experimental methods for UTF-8. Originally tested in Linux
  and ported to Windows for OBV/2. Custom build of Boost with ICU for Boost 
  boundary and translations for Windows.  Allot of extra work to compile with 
  MingW32.

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-25 Working on Telnet Command and Option Replies and Responses.
+ Worked out TELNET OPTS for TTYPE, NAWS, LINEMODE toggle off for Linux.
  completed connect tests in windows, Linux and OS/x terminals.

Change Log Update
* 2015-08-17 Started logging updates and changes
+ Added Communicator Class with SafeQueue for global messaging between 
  sessions and the system operator.
+ Updated Telnet Option Parsing, Added Containers for Reply and Active.
  Waiting for reply avoid sending reply's on responses. Active will heep track
  of options agreed upon between client and server.
+ Working on adding TTYPE and NAWS parsing. Have initial stages completed.

Ideas: 
+ Global Trivial that can display random questions and let users answer from 
  any subsystem. Also keeping ongoing totals and counts through the week 
  pre-determined time frame.

+ Global Chat / Teleconference like IRC where users can chat, ANSI draw together,
  and transfer files.
